I put these in a new bass I built last week.
They sound awesome with lots of punch and, they stay clean on the low notes. Im impressed with em.
The down side would be:
1. The covers are not connected to the pickups and, the adjustment springs support the covers. So, you need to glue the covers on so the weight of the pickup doesn't pull loose and fall into the cavity over time. I used clear epoxy and, hoping for the best since I sold the bass when it was finished. On a positive note, the screws and springs were included which was very nice.
2. The covers have sharper corners than standard precision bass pickups so, if you use a template to route cavities,  you'll probably have to go back and chisel the corners like I did.
Im not a fan of that since it doesn't look as professional but, I was using a chrome pickup cover so, it worked out.
The owner of the bass can't say enough about their sound and, I would buy them again.
