I am 61 years old,been playing since 14. I have bought 4 or 5 Crescents over the years and have not found a lemon yet. These are great guitars!!!!!! I left the strings that came with it on,and after they quit stretching(like any set of strings will do)it stays perfectly tuned. I will be buying more to start a good collection and would highly recommend this to a friend. It is a keeper for sure!!

This is the review I gave some months back. I thought I would give an update.
Since purchasing this guitar,I have also purchased a Rondo SX,Hadean Tele,Epiphone Les Paul, Huntington Tele, Davison strat and an Oscar Schmidt Les Paul. I play in an old 60's style band and use my Crescent on stage. It's light,it stays in tune and the action I set perfect and the neck is comfortable and fast. I love playing my other guitars,but this Crescent is my workhorse. Ya gotta buy one.
