Arrived in 2 days with prime in safe packaging. Minor paint flaws with semi gloss finish. Plywood and plastic construction with painted plastic fretboard. Has plastic tuning keys and metal tuning gears on headstock. Paint wore away quickly on the side of fretboard at the top of the neck. The strings on the ukulele are not of quality but the ukulele can take brand name strings and tune them correctly. The bridge and nut need filing in order to effectively play chords or scales so I would consider it a novelty uke. Perfect for a toddler or young child to use instead of an expensive instrument, but will not be good to learn on or take lessons with. False spruce top and stained mahogany back and sides give it an expensive look that kids will love. Adult supervision required as there are moving parts. I bought this for my son who is turning two years old this May. See photo for comparison of an acoustic guitar (spruce top, catalpa back and sides) vs. the soprano ukulele
