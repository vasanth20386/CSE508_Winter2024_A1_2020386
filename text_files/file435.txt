VERSATILITY/MULTIPLAYER MIC-RECORDER

I love my Zoom h4n! It is great! for the longest time I used it as a mic and then I also used it as a audio interface and I started to record tracks! the technology on this thing is top notch!  Great for practicing, vlogging, and taking notes....I still use it as my main mic with my camera... see attached picture for my set up!

Sound clarity is unbelievable! and price is always changing and going on sale too! Zoom has some great product, but this one stands on top!
