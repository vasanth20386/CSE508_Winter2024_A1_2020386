This is a great cartridge.  It was easy to setup and has a very nice sound.  I also have a Shure m97xe, but I prefer the sound of this one.  Originally, I had issues with it.  The sound was muffled and flat.  To correct it, I reinstalled the stylus until it clicked onto the front.  Sounds great now.

I have it installed with the standard Technics alignment using the 52mm gauge.  It plays well setup like this on my SL-23 and sounds best to me over other alignments.  It seems to be sensitive to the VTA(rake) of the stylus.  With the standard mat, the angle was lower at the front.  Adding a 2nd mat raised the front higher and it made a huge difference.  Well worth the work.  Check the manual located at http://www.sumikoaudio.net/ContentsFiles/oys_oyster(4).pdf for other adjustments.
