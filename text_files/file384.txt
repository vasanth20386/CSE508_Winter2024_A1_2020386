This is not Fretboard Oil Cleaner. It is pure magic! If you love your guitars and basses, you will purchase this immediately and start treating them with the love and care they deserve. It is sooooo easy to use, and a little goes a very long way. I recently worked on a mid '60s Harmony Rocket and the fretboard was, well, disgusting. I have included some before and after pics of the fretboard after crowning and polishing the frets and then cleaning it using Nomad. Judge for yourself.
