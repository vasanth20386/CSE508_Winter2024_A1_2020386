This thing works great. I hooked it up to my ATR2100 along with a NEEWER scissor arm (without a shock mount) and I did some tests to see how my plosives were. It makes a great difference, especially since you have to get pretty close to this type of microphone (dynamic). It may be a cheap buy, but it's definitely quality and does what it needs to.
