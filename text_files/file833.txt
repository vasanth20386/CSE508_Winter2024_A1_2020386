I am building a recording studio. Every studio I've been to; you always expect a humongous mixer, a mac, very expensive condenser mic, and black mic cables. I wanted something unique and different. The connectors are sold and very nice! Cable is thick and sturdy. When I bend the cable I don't feel wires moving around inside. Very well made! You will like these cables!
