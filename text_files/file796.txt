Installed these on a cheap, beat-up Juan Estruch classical guitar that I got at a flea market for $25.  It's a surprisingly nice guitar, but one of the tuners was bent, one was completely broken, and all were rusty.  I ordered these as a new replacement that would fix these problems without costing as much as the guitar itself did.

Overall these have done an excellent job for the price paid.  No, they're not perfect or incredible.  They were also a little scratched out of the packaging, and shipping took around a month from China.  All that being said, they do the job well for pretty much the lowest price possible, and I have no real complaints.

I wouldn't recommend these on a decent guitar that's already working well, but for a cheap fix or an improvement on a very cheap or beat-up guitar, these fit the bill perfectly.

Please rate up if I was able to help you a bit :)
