For practical purposes, these patches are thin (which I like) and clear (if you get the clear ones).  They are not hard "plasticky" (yes, I made up a new word...remember you heard it here first) but have a snug, comfortable feel under the teeth. I use them on my OBrien crystal and Richard Hawkins Model G mouthpieces and they look great.  Now, the best thing about them for me personally is the R....my name is Robert.  Hah.  Looks like I have custom mouthpiece patches. ;-)
