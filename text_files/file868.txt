I needed an inexpensive set of tuners for a low budget bass project and these fit.  While the lower quality does exhibit itself during tuning, they do work.  As long as one doesn't expect quality at this price point, they do the job.  I've had them mounted on the bass for about a month now, and they don't hold the tune as well as Hipshot, Grover, or other quality tuners, but I am happy with the performance at this price.
