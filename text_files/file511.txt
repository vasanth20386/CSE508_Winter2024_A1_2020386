I loved using this while producing videos with my Canon EOS 6D, but it didn't last long.  When I inserted the battery into the receiver, one of the battery contacts broke off.  Here are some pictures of the receiver mounted on my EOS 6D and a picture showing the broken contact wire.  The battery holder has a bad design because the contacts are weak wire loops and the battery fits very snug and puts a lot of pressure on these weak contacts.  Samson should update the battery holder design.  I still recommend this wonderful wireless system, just something to be aware of.
