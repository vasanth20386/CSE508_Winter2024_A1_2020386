I cannot say enough good things about this particular guitar strap. I have several Walker & Williams straps and not a one of them is a loser, but when I pulled this out of the packaging yesterday, I immediately fell in love with it. Buttery smooth, real leather smell, nice stitching - just an overall quality piece of work. Looks beautiful on my Hagstrom. Couldn't be happier.
