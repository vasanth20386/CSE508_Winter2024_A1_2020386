I think the amount of positive feedback these mics are receiving should tell you something about how amazing they sound. I just simply want to say that if you purchase these mics, do yourself a huge favor and buy a 6" gooseneck! I use my Spirits for drum overheads and apart from them sounding incredible, adding a little gooseneck makes this a perfect microphone. The internal shock absorption is actually really impressive! Amazing mics for the money! Grab you a couple!
