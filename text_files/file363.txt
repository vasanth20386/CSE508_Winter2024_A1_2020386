Bought it as a gift for my brother, but got to play around with it for a couple of days. Sounds great, doesn't go out of tune too much, but I read that is normal in new instruments so no worries there.

I would give it 5 stars but I didn't get the "free" gift bag that is mentioned in the name of the product. Called amazon and after telling me they would refund me the cost of the bag, the agent told me about the item condition description that mentioned: "Item has no cosmetic scratches or blemishes. Item has no cracks or dents. Missing Case. Item will come in original packaging. Packaging will be damaged.".

I honestly didn't know what "warehouse deals" exactly were, so I guess the fault was mine but maybe I would have gotten another one since what finally convinced me into buying this one was the gig bag.

Did read a few similar cases that happened to other buyers, no bags or tuners were delivered so careful with this.

I repeat, great instrument and I AM happy with the purchase.
