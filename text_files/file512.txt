I received this and a InnoGear Studio Recording Condenser Microphone in exchange for an honest review, and I have to say as a podcaster and host of a radio show that I am able to do online this works amazing well.

I was familiar with products by InnoGear but now I have new respect for them because of this phantom power supply that allows you to do great things with the microphone, improving your sound in a big way.

The power supply is packaged nicely and travels well. I've take a few shots to allow you to see how easy it is to plug in your cable to the mic and get started without a lot of fuss.

Totally worth the price and definitely something that podcasters and online radio show hosts can benefit from because of the quality.
