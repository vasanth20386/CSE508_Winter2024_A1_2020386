I had read another review in here from someone using this with the MXL V67G after popping out the existing mounting ring with a flat blade screwdriver, so I took a chance and ordered one for myself.  That guy was 100% correct! I just popped out the existing mounting ring with a flat blade and my V67G slipped right in and could be tighly secured using the black mounting ring supplied with the V67G.

I had read a lot of negative reviews about the MXL shockmount for this microphone so I didn't want that one.  This shockmount bears a striking resemblance to the MXL 890 shockmount that came standard with my 890 vocal mic and with the same quality of construction.  The price is definitely more than fair for what you get here!

So... If you have an MXL V67G order with confidence!  I would say that this would be a much better choice than the MXL alternative.

I was also blown away how fast Amazon got this thing to me!  I ordered it last night and it showed up on my front porch this afternoon!
