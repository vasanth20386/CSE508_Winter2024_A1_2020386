This light is awesome!!! Very bright with 54 one watt diodes. Throws a nice medium wash they are great. The only down side I have with them is a power cable being attached to the fixture instead of an iec cable. It has dmx in and out. The housing is a very tough plastic and also includes the hanging bracket. The par is a flat par which is great for up lighting. I think this is a great fixture so I give it a 5 stars
