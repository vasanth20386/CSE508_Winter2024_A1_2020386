Great quality patch cables!

I wanted something other than those cheap blue, green, red and yellow patch cables because I didn't want to replace the cables on my pedal board several times a year.

I purchased these because they had excellent reviews and I'd like to add to those because they are great cables, well built, feel sturdy and have a great quality feel. I get great tones from my pedals and amp and they were the perfect link for me. If you're on the fence about the Hosa CPE-118, go for it, you will be happy with them!
