I got this for my Ibanez EW20ASE.... the pin on the back of the body by the neck was too far recessed to get the rigid plastic ratched clasp on it.... I was mad for about 10 seconds. Great quality strap, looks fantastic, feels great to the hand and the locks are nothing to sneeze at, they really lock to your pins. So, I took it and put it on my Ibanez AS93 (a fairly heavy guitar for being semi-hollow) and they fit, perfectly. I had just done a string change and spent a little over an hour playing and breaking the strings in, this strap is super comfy (especially for not being padded). The material is somewhere between satin and a seatbelt with a cool stitched "xxx/diamond" design (that's my words, not Planet Waves). Absolutely love it and VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND for use with any guitar that doesn't have recessed strap pins) A++++++
