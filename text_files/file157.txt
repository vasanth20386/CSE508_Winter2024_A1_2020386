I have owned two Martins over the years. I have been playing only electric guitars the last many years. I came across some old songs I wrote for the acoustic guitar. I tested several guitars because I wanted a nice kick back acoustic that covered all the base and mids I remember from the Martin coffee house days. I did not like the new guitars, they did not sound the way I remember them. I walked out of my favorite music stores with out any guitar. My friend told me to try a Canadian made guitar a Seagull. I never heard of them. I saw a few for sale used, that's good because I wanted an old one. I tested a 1996 S6 Seagull and the sound, power and tone from this guitar was fantastic. I bought it, set the action very low and put some #9 strings one it. This cedar top has a magic to it and I am pleased with this one. Just as fine to play as the crazy priced guitars.
