The Ditto is the best looper I've owned (I've tried a few). It's very easy to use.

One design flaw: putting the power and input plugs next to each other. My Ditto doesn't sit flat because the power and audio cords are in the way of each other. The power plug should have gone on the top, in my opinion.
