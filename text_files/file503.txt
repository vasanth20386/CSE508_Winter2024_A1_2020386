I own 3 of these Minis.  Quality on this one is the worst. Glue joints at the neck/body were messy. Had a couple of small dings (see photo of one under strings near bridge) but the important stuff is OK ( neck is straight and the bridge is sound). Fret edges are very smooth. Sounds great but not as good as the Ovangkol.
