I wanted to add karaoke to my services for my mobile DJ business and was looking for something that didn't cost and arm and a leg. I wanted to find something mobile, easy to set-up & affordable. After reading reviews, it was a no brainer so I made the purchase. The stand is sturdy, light, portable & very easy to set-up. I have my 20" Sharp Aquos mounted on it (see pictures uploaded), and it took me less than five minutes to set up! The only complaint I have is the screws for the mic holders do not fit. They are a tad too big. Either the screws are too big or the holes were not made large enough. It's no big deal. I highly recommend this product. Buy it!!!
