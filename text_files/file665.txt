With a much needed modification, this became a far more durable board.
I do wish they chose to use a heavier duty zipper, but this one has done OK so far (almost a year old)

Modification Details (see pics)
Purchase 1/8" particle board from hardware store ($4.99)
Use Exacto knife to remove flimzy foam from bottom of gig bag
Use the foam as template to cut the particle board
Slide the cut board in
Use glue gun to seal
Optional, use the removed foam from bottom to strengthen the top of the bag by slicing it and adding it.

You now have a much more durable board, AND retained all of the usable velcro
Was easy enough to mod

FYI: The white pedal (One control Loop) allows me to A/B between two effect return paths, so I don't have to hit more than that single button to go from my chosen clean tone (with it's effects) to my chosen dirty tone (with it's effects). This means I never have to have access to the foot switches on each pedal, so I was able to squeeze in tons of units.
