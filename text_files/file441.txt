Actually surprised. I originally intended to use this as a low gain type pedal but when I unintentionally cascades this into my Rat 2 pedal, a magical thing happened. This guy opened up the mids in the rat pedal. I am running the rat at 18volts with excellent results. This drive pedal is set at gain 2 and cascading into the rat pedal. Excellent! Immediately earning a prized spot on my board.
