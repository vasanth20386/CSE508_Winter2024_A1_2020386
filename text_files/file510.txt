Quality is what I need! I was tempted to go with Behringer, but it originates in China, I have already experienced background noise and some power issues with previous versions do I said no. This has been fantastic on the other hand. Got this about over eight months ago, and so far it's been nothing but reliable and still can be used for quality audio. Also, Yamaha derives from Japan so wow, what a major difference. Thank you!
