The flute came in good shape, but there are two holes in the under side bottom, toward the end, with both holes connecting to one another at a 45 degree angle.  There's no way to cover these holes and play the flute.  I'm guessing it's a manufacturing mistake, where someone got a little too happy with the hole drilling!!
