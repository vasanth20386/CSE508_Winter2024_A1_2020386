Overall, this neck is a good deal. It's straight, level and the wood has nice grain. Everything seems to intonate correctly. It fit my VM Squire Telecaster neck pocket perfectly. I had to file 7 frets to level it, but I guessed that going in.
My neck is kind of chunky with a 12" radius. It's a bit more "D" shape than the stock neck.
Finish work is what's to be expected at this price point. Its coated in a thin layer of pale satin poly. Heel end and 22nd fret lip are rough. Contour around truss adjust was so crooked I had to measure nut slot to make sure it wasn't the real problem. Frets are not very tall and on the soft side.
If I were in a pinch, I would order this again. Id have no problem recommending to thrifty guitarists.
