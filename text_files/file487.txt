I put this on a Yamaha drum rack. The tubes are rather large and this thing opened just wide enough to clamp on. I was really surprised. When I first opened the packed I was thinking I'd have to send it back, but it works perfectly and the clamp is very secure. I submitted a picture of it installed. It doesn't look like it's on all the way, but this thing hasn't moved in almost a year!! I would highly recommend this product!!
