This pop filter works perfect and I like that it's easily adjustable. The images show a all black pop filter but I received a white and pink/purple filter. That's the only reason I'm going to give it 3 starts. Isn't a little strange and everyone always comments on that fact. It kind of throws off the vibe of my booth. I'll be purchasing anyone some time in the future from a different company most likely because I want a black one. Image attached.
