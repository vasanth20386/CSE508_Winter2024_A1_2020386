A big improvement over stock pickups on my 1960 Reissue Stratocaster. Lots of high end snap, much less noise, decent balance between pick ups, classic look. Easy to install but does require soldering. The instructions (really just a wiring diagram) could be a bit clearer so be sure and make note of the existing wiring before you des older and remove the old pickups.
