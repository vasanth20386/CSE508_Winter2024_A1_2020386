I love how this baby sounds! It has a nice full loud sound. Tones are just right! Its better looking than the pictures they give you. I no its an Epiphone but I would play this guitar anywhere! I have several guitars but I can't set this baby down! I have Grover locking gold tuners that will go right on!
