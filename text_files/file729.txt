I love this guitar. You can have a clean tone or a crunch tone which is perfect for what I play. It was my first bass and I got it at a local used gear shop. I have had it for a little over a year and it has been through a lot. It sounds great and it is REALLY durable and can go through a lot. I have played this bass every where I have played
