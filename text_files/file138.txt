I was looking for an second inexpensive ukulele for traveling or camping.  To my surprise this is a wonderful ukulele!  Its light weight construction makes its tone warm, bright and rich.  The construction on the instrument is very high quality.  If your looking for a beautifully designed comfortable playing ukulele, look no more.  Even the etching on the body is very nice.  Luna makes a few other designs in this etched series.  So if you don't like this design there are others to choose from.  I would highly recommend Luna's Mahogany Mo's Concert Ukulele to anyone who wants a high quality ukulele without spending a lot of money. And it even comes with a nice soft Luna case.
