This product so far has been absolutely stunning. I believe that it most definitely CAN be used for professional soundtracks and music. But duh, FL Studio is for the super duper professionals, blah, blah, blah. I use it for my YouTube channel it's been nothing but wonders for me! It's funny because when I first received the item, I SUCKED at doing anything on this software. Then, five days later of experience and watching about two videos on this, I felt like a confident pro! If you're frustrated at first with the software then don't fret. You're not the only one, and you'll get the hang of it.
