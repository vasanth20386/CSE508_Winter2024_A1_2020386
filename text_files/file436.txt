It's built solidly but the tolerances and alignment of the various holes leave a lot to be desired, you have to be somewhat forceful in a few instances in order to get it to stay together straight. Once that was taken care of, there's really nothing to complain about, the unit is reasonably sturdy (don't jump on it, but it will hold your instruments no problem) and it's working very well for me. How well? Look at the picture!
