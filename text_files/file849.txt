A great product, which made a wonderful under-bed light in our application.

- Length is perfect for a kings size frame,  Start about 1 food from the headboard, and this will cover the permitter all the way around, with adjustment for your particular bed

- The dimming feature is great and a must if you will use it for a nightlight application.  In fact, the lights are so bright you have to keep them at or near the dimmest level for an under-bed nightlight application.

- Every LED lit up.  No dead diodes.

Why the deduction?

- The adhesive back could be stickier.  I used regular scotch tape to strength where it would not adhere.  I think it will stick best to non-textured and gloss surfaces.

- The lead wire going to an from the dimmer would ideally be about 3-6" longer on each end.

- Although I purchased the warm light, like most LEDs, the color temperature becomes cooler with dimming.
