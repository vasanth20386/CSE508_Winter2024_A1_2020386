I traded for a TMB100 in sea foam green recently and I was pleased with the construction. The wiring is good. After I set it up everything was great. My only complaint is that I had the bass only 24 hrs before the Tone/Bass knob snapped off in my hand, right at the base as I was adjusting the tone, rendering them useless and stuck in their current configuration. I didn't really think I was cranking it that hard. Now I have to buy a $60 preamp knob before my next show and be terrified that I'm gonna snap it off again. tldr: Great guitar. Needs a setup. Be careful with the specific expensive knobs.
