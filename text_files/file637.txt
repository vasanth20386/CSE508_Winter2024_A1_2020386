It seriously sounds better than it has any right to at this price range, and I love it.  Great if you want to do some recording in an area that is not sound treated that you can't get away with using a condenser microphone in.  It has a lot of character as it's frequency response is far from flat.  Attenuation of the lows and a pretty beefy boost in the presence without going too bright.  It's a bit louder that the Shure sm58, but not hugely.  Still needs quite a bit of preamp, about 70% up on my preamp to remain in unity on my mixer for reasonable recording levels.  It's got a good sound to it.  I think it's super short sighted of Behringer to fail to include the frequency profile of this microphone on the Amazon store page, but don't worry I've got you all covered.  The picture attached is a document included with my microphone which SHOULD have been on this store page, and will give you an idea of what this microphone will sound like.
