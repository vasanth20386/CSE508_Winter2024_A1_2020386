I recently got a used, but excellent, Epiphone Junior.  I've been playing for over fifty years and owned many -- many quite fine, costly, guitars. But as others have discovered, these older, P90-equipped Epis belie their cost. They play and sound GREAT.  With one exception: They come with pretty poor tuners.

A guitar forum friend had suggested these Grovers and I'm glad I listened. They are quality pieces that, apart from the mounting screw placement, are complete "drop ins."

Fairly priced here on Amazon.  I could not be more pleased!
