It works, for the price, for what it is. I needed a gig bag, at about 25 dollars in a hurry, for carrying my carry around bass around town- in/ out car, hanging out at coffee shops, walking around place to place. If I had about 50 dollars I would have bought the next model up, the G4 or whatever, with more padding, but I didn't, and this one is doing the job just fine. I have a Precision Bass copy (an Epiphone Accu-Bass, hence the weird headstock) , and it fits in the bag.  The bag is protective enough and seems durable enough for the purpose of carrying the bass around town. The pocket won't hold much- just strings and some music, but the bag does carry the bass.
