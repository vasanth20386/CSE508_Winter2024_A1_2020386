I put a set of these on a Jag I finished up a few weeks ago and I'm thoroughly impressed.

I used the mounting plates for install because even w/ a drill press and depth stop bits it's still a time consuming pain drilling those holes and the plates seem to provide secure and well aligned mounting w/ just the bushings clamping the tuners down.

The action of the tuners is super smooth and accurate feeling w/ zero slippage and the button shape is very comfortable and effective.  They seem quicker to tune w/ for me than I would expect from the 18:1 ratio.  I think they look great too.

I've liked them so much on the Jag I've got another set of these (and one of their Contour strat bridges) on the way for the next build.
