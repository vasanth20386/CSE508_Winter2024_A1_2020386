the harp I got was a 5 inch 12 hole C key harp  not the 4 inch 10 hole harp that was pictured.  this harp will not fit in the small harp holder so I had to borrow someone's holder at the last gig.  Since I used the harp I am not going to return it but I'm not happy that I have to buy the harp again - the correct harp.  The harp they send me was a good harp but not what I wanted.
