Well...it plays perfectly, but the once clear, white on blue lettering rubs right off. Body's natural oils... rub whatever paint they use. I'm considering buying a perm marker in a bright color and drawing them on again. Yes, the gold side is embossed, so it won't rub off, but it's the blue on white that a person looks to for quickly identifying notes. Long-term, it's more about the pitches being stable/etc., but I'm disappointed that only after three uses, the lettering is rubbing off. Put a better finish on these things...coat it with something non-toxic, but non-reactive with oils/acids from people's fingers since that's what we'll be using when we hold the things. Other than storage at home, the soft pouch is useless.
