A lot of the reviews for this are divided. "Oh, it sounds great," and "sounds like a s***ty gong" come to mind. I bought it anyways. It is definitely a cheap buy, and still looks like an amazing cymbal. As for sound, it does sound pretty crappy. But it's still a great buy for beginner drummers, or drummer who just like to jam out in their basements/garage. Once you start to get a gig or two, you should consider going with a better cymbal

UPDATE: I've had the cymbal for about 1.5 years, and it's cracked to the point where I can't play it anymore. It's MOST likely because of the way I've been hitting it, and NOT because of crappy manufacturing. As I look at my old review I think I was a bit critical. I've grown to love the bright sound of this cymbal, and will probably buy another one
