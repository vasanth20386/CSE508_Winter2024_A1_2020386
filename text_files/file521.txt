There is not any noise during use, and not heating with 8 pedals powered on running for 5 hours, the voltage of each channel keeps the same. Stable power supplying. With 7 X 9V 100mA +1 X 9V 500mA+1 X 12V 100mA+1 X 18V 100mA can work for at least 10 pedals easily. 10X50 cm cables are long enough to reach any part of the pedal board. Small size, and will not taking up too much pace. The Polarity Reversal Cable can help you cope with different pedals. Stable output and cost-effective. Provides 10 power outputs, it is able to work for a standard pedalboard. But the price is not so expensive as the Voodoo Lab or T-Rex, etc, you can easily have a power supply to work for your own pedals. I am quite satisfied with the price and stability overall it is very worth having. NO HUM! EXCELLENT POWER! GET ONE!
