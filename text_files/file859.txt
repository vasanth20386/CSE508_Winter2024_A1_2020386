Have never tried these before- just put them on two of my basses. I usually play a set of strings 'til a string breaks- so a very long time. After about a month of playing they still sound fairly new, I think they sound good, feel good, and have even response up and down and across the fretboard.

In the pictures I included, the Epiphone Accu-Bass is a string-through body (to explain why the silks line up differently).

I will have to update this review later after I get more experience with playing these strings, but so far so good.
