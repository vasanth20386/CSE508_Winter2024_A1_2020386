I previously purchased the 20' cable for my SG and Marshall amp, and I was very satisfied. I have a couple of pedals with different variations that I wanted to incorporate, and the old saying "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" came to mind. So I ordered 2 of the 6' cables to complete my personal set up. You can't go wrong with these. Great Cords!
