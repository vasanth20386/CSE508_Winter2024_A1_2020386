This bridge cover is beautiful. It really adds flare and character to your bass. I personally added it to a Squier Bronco bass that I've modded with Mustang parts.

Be aware that this is much larger than the Precision Bass bridge cover. If your style is to play at/near the bridge area, this cover will definitely get in the way.

***No screws are included. The standard pickguard screws work just fine. I recommend either buying a pack from Amazon, or head to the local hardware store to save some money.
