Awesome bass. I love it. As some other reviewers have commented this bass is not balanced as a standard solid body bass. the neck is definitely heavier due to the hollow body, but you know, that's the way it goes. I love the sound the hollow body gives you sounds a bit like my acoustic bass. The controls give a nice variety of sounds. I am something of a novice player but wanted to add a hollow body bass to my small collection and this Hofner replica is just the ticket. I think I might replace the strings that it came with as they sound a too metallic for my taste, but they are playable and hold tune well. I was able to play this bass right out of the box once I tuned it. No need for adjusting and didn't have that fret buss some reviewers have commented on. I did notice the neck is slimmer and the strings are closer together than any of my other basses, so that is an adjustment, but didn't take long to get into the swing of things. Fun to play and lightweight. Recommended.
