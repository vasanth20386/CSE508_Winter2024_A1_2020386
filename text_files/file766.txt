Was skeptical after reading previous reviews. Very happy with this chair. To be used for saxophone playing. Very easy to assemble as most is already put together. The backing of the backrest and seat isn't the greatest, but will do. The backrest does clank, but a trip to the hardware store and pick up those cork round pads for cabinets, problem solved. This chair is comfortable to me and sturdy enough. I gambled and won with this chair.
