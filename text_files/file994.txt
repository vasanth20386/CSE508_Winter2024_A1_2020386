I played a wedding today using the Alaska picks on my thumb and ring finger.  They were very comfortable and stayed on my finger well without being to tight.  For my fingers I cut the extra piece off and just used the smaller part.  It fits snug under my nail and is the perfect length. For my thumb I used the full size of the pick and it worked great.  The material is easy to bend and shape using a file and buffing blocks.  This produces a naturally smooth sound that you can get with your nails.  I got the medium size. They fit great on all my fingers but I might try the larger version for my thumb but the medium works great if you bend the plastic back and it makes it looser around the thumb.
