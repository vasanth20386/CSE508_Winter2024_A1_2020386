Just what inwas specting to keep my mobile recording studio on the go. Don't let the "cable bag" fool you, this bag can keep more than just cables and is pretty customizable.  I recommend using it with khanka bags to give extra protection even though the bag is sturdy enough but to keep equipment more in place nice and tight. I would've preffered buying the large size but for now im happy with this one. I would recommend this to a friend and would buy another one again!
