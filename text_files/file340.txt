I love D'Addario strings, however, this particular set when installed on my 28.625" scale 8-string - the top .74 string was not wound far enough to reach the nut. This left me with roughly 1/3" of the string that does not match (Pic). I'm honestly not sure if this is an isolated incident or if all packs will yield the same result. I will give them another try in hopes of a better set, but if this is the standard then D'Addario should really consider the extended scale of 8-string guitars and ensure the strings are wound far enough.
