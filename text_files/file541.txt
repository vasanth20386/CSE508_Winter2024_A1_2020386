Many people think that a electric guitar for around 100 bucks is cheap and sounds terrible. this guitar makes that opinion wrong. this guitar is amazing for the price. the first part of the guitars character you notice is the beautiful red color. it looks beautiful and is really eye catching. the playability is nice with a good action. the strings it comes with are decent factory strings but i changed them anyway for better sound. the volume and tone knobs are cool looking also. the tune o matic bridge helps alot and kept my guitar in tune for days. this guitar also comes with a amp cable , some papers, owners guide, a poster and a big epiphone sticker. who doesnt love stickers? lol. i highly recommend this guitar to beginners and those who have been playing for a while. the sound quality is amazing for the price you get.
