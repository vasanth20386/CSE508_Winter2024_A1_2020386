I bought this 2 months ago and just now got a chance to put it on my Tele but it does NOT fit! It's too small and the holes don't match!

EDIT: I got a response from them and they offered to return 30% of my money back and I get to keep the item. I'm not sure what I could do with it since it doesn't fit my Tele but it's good enough, I suppose. I'd rather have 100% of my money back since the product is misleading. Maybe it only fits on certain types of Telecasters?

EDIT #2: So they emailed me again and offered a FULL refund since the item was of no use to me. Now THAT is customer service! Customer service like that is few and far between. 5 stars!
