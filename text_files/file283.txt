Worked Great in my kit build.  Had to enlarge the holes a tiny bit as they are ever so slightly larger then the stock that came with the kit.  They still stand a tad proud of the bridge but they do hold the strings well and it makes them easier to remove.  They look fantastic, great buy for the money.
