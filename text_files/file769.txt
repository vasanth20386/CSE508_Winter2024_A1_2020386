I like Tascam products. I have a rack mounted digital recorder, a CD player and a small digital recorder. The 100mkII is also a very good recorder but I have some complaints: The battery life is short maybe because it uses only 2 cells. The volume control is very close to the phone jack making adjustment a bit dificult. The door of the AA cells seems the door of a cheap toy; it could be more robust. Apart from these minor details I'm well satisfied with the product.
