Great item, I installed it with no problems, I ordered together with the Shure A26X 3 Inch extension,following the recommendations of one reviewer here on Amazon, I'm glad I did, my Keyboard it's the Yamaha PSR S900, which has built in speakers and makes the keyboard "thicker/Higher" than a regular keyboard so the extension it's definitely needed. I also order the OnStage Boom stand arm, everything works great I also ordered[To arrive Thursday] the quick clip extension just to make it easier to remove.
