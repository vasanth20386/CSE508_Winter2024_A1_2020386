I have to give these pickups 5 stars for bang for buck!  I bought this last year for an 96' Korean Squire that I have been slowly but surely replacing everything on as a learning project.  Time marched on and I finally put them in tonight and all I have to say is Wow!  The difference in these and the originals is just off the scale.  I never realized how much amp hiss I was getting until I plugged these in for the first time.  I had to actually hit a string to make sure it was working.  I can not say enough good things about these affordable pickups.  I have another MIM strat with some boutique pickups that are marketed as noiseless but I honestly believe I actually like the tone of these better for a fraction of the cost. If you have an old Strat laying around these are the pickups you need to bring it roaring back to life.  I have attached a pic for those who wonder how the covered pickups look installed.
