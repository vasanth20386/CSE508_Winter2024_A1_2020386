I have the 7 guitar version of this same stand (which costs less).  As I said in that review, put it together loosely, then, if all is good, tighten it down.  The instructions are OK, just make sure that you read them and identify all the parts (some look alike but are slightly different).  Poor reviews must be by the mechanically challenged.  You get what you pay for - even though the bigger stand costs less - but it works fine.  I have some very expensive instruments in mine with no worries.
