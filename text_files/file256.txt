All I can say is wow! This has to be the best amp at this price. I chose this over the fender and I'm glad I did. It is clean-sounding smooth has a great tone nice design easily move it around even though it does weigh over 30 lb. This is a bargain I'm glad I went with this brand. The size is big enough to punch out for mid sized church functions with ease! The pic doesn't really show u the size. It's bigger than the pic puts out. No distortion just a clean bass sound... Again A bargain and I will buy a bigger one in the future!
