These speakers sound great! I've had a pair of cube Auratone reference monitors for 30 yrs that still sound great but these iLouds are another level. Strong bass, crystal clear mids and highs. They are computer speakers on steroids! The pairing of inboard amp matched perfectly with the drivers makes sure you are getting great sound. They are Bluetooth capable too which I didn't even notice at first because it isn't stated loudly on the package. They aren't inexpensive but neither are good microphones and guitars. If you can afford the price, you will be pleased. Luckily my girlfriend gave me mine for Christmas :) Thank You Love!
