NOT as advertised.  They claim these are Rapco Horizon Cables, but they are actually Stagemaster - whoever that is.  Rapco Horizon cables offer a lifetime warranty and they LAST!!!  I have some that are just going bad after 14 years of weekly use.  This is a bait and switch - do NOT be deceived like I was.
