This pickup has a great, traditional, single coil strat sound. I'm really pleased with the sweet clear tone this delivers. You can make it scream with your amp setting if that's what you want. It's really great looking, too! I had no issues at all with the soldering connections, and the volume and tone pots work well as does the jack. I used this on a cigar box guitar build, and I love the tone! This homemade CBG sounds like a legitimate strat. I would definitely use this pickup again in the future, and I have no doubt it would sound good to swap out the pups on a cheapo commercial strat with these. My only complaint, and it's a small one, is that the knobs included had a tiny bit of smearing on the gold paint. It's not a big deal because many pups don't include knobs at all, and there are so many knob options available at very affordable prices. I actually used the knobs anyway, so I'm not going to knock a star off for that. The tone and looks of the pickup are fantastic at this price!
