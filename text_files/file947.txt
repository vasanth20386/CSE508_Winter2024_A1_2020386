As I am sure that you know, this is a Fulltone OCD clone and let me tell you that it is the closest to a perfect clone in sound as you can get. I love this pedal and because of this one will probably be buying many more Joyo products. I wasn't a huge fan of the paint job on the product so I pulled it apart and used ceramic resin engine paint to coat it. I love this pedal and would recommend it to anyone!
