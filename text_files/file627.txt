I originally installed these on my semi-hollow body Gretch D6128 Thunderbass in an attempt to cut down on the string and fret noise I was getting with conventional strings.

These not only reduced those issues considerably, the tone is fantastic!  I have been using these on the Gretch now for over 18 months and have nothing but praise for these strings!  The red color also adds a very unique look to the instrument and I am always getting compliments on the look!

In addition to my D6128, I have also installed a set of these on my Candy Apple Red Fender Jaguar short scale bass with equally impressive results.

The string itself is the time tested DR Sunbeam round core with the custom micro-coating applied.  The same great tone you get from the Sunbeam string with the added benefit of reduced string and fret noise.

I can't recommend these strings highly enough for anyone looking for a quality coated string.
