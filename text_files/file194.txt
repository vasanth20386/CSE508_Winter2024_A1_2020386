Superb feel and sound!

Tips for wah success:
- rock pedal all of the way forward
- match the volume knob to your Bass
- crank the "Q"
- love life!

Seriously, the range this pedal hits when the "Q" is amazing. I love how expressive the tone is when you get it going! I think it retains the low end and adds a creamy wah in the highs and mids. Don't listen to nay-sayers that claim you lose lows!

To put it bluntly, it's needed on your board!
I've used it with delays, octave up/downs, and overdrives, and just the straight-up clean; never found a sound I didn't like or couldn't use!

Buy it.
