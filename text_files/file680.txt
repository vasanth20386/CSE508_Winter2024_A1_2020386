Not real happy with this but then I wanted to save some money.  Not a very good decision on my part.  Should have shelled out the $30-35 for an actual Fender or Fender licensed pickguard so I'll eat this.  But I'm posting so YOU don't have to make my mistake.  Not knocking the company either, they tried but just didn't get it right.  See the pics.
