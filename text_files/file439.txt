I just wanted to say that the Fender Vintage Noiseless Pickups were a great upgrade to my 2012 Fender Standard Stratocaster.  They provide a much cleaner, bell-like tone compared to the factory-fitted pickups.  The factory pickups are actually great for gritty blues and rock, but my playing is mostly clean, so I prefer the sound of the Vintage Noiseless.  Also, the package I got had the updated wiring diagram (correct!) - the only issue is that is didn't show how to connect the output jack hot wire, but it is shown on the wiring diagram from Fender's website (for the American Deluxe Stratocaster).  I installed the new pots, capacitors, resistor that came in the package and this gave me the cleanest, brightest tone.  If you want a warmer tone, you can probably skip doing this.
