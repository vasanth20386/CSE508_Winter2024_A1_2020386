These guitar straps are downright luxurious. So comfortable and absolutely beautiful. I have two beautiful Dixon Hummingbirds, and these are the only straps that are just as beautiful as my guitars. I loved the first one I bought so much that I bought two more. I put one on on my pretty Schecter SIII Custom electric guitar as well. They are really well made. I have not seen better quality on another strap I've owned.
