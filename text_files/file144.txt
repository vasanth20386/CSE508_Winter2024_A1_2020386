Cool little portable sound amplifier, for when you just got to make noise without waking the neighborhood! Very light, hope it's impact resistant so I can stuff it in a back pack with other goodies. I'm using it for harmonica, slide guitar, or as a powered speaker for my media players. The sound is decent and the battery seem to last long enough. I am happy with this purchase. Way to go Danelectro!
