The quality of this bass trap is amazing. I record all kinds of music and when mastering a song with heavy bass leads I need to hear it as clearly as possible. This works perfectly. I have trouble hearing someone speaking on the other side of the room. I may have over done it, but the room is so muffed from any sound its almost erie... Well worth the money! By the way, when I'm not recording I use this room to play Xbox One on. The bass is so crisp and clear. Its better then a movie theater!
