These strings were reccomended to me by an acquaintance of mine during a bass clinic I attended recently.  I ordered them right away.. All i can say is WOW! Excellent tone. It really brightened up my sound. I had gotten used to muddy sounding strings.  I haven't noticed a sticky feeling like others have mentioned, mine are silky smooth. Great playability. Wasn't too concerned about color, But When I installed them on my Ferrari red Carvin LB 70, I fell in love with my bass all over again.  It looks stunning, and I get many comments about my bass now..Others have mentioned that the color wears off quickly, but I don't care, I'll used the color wear as a guage of when to change them..Then neon ones even glow brightly under a black light.  Bass players don't get much credit so why not give them a show and something to talk about.
