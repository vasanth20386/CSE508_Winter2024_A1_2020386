I bought these for my office. I wanted to put a barrier between the speaker phone and the wall to help reduce echo and keep my nosy neighbor from listening in. I can't tell if you if it works for the neighbor but the echo is gone now. I also have my computer speakers near them as well and that seems to shield a little noise too.

These had trouble sticking on my wall at first, I ended up using industrial velcro, it just wouldn't hold with anything else. I'm pretty happy with them and they don't look that bad either.
