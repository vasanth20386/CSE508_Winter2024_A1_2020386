This kick-pad is excellent. It additionally lowers the sound of your bass drum, so if you're not satisfied with the sound, this will help. It lasts very long and can take a beating of all kinds, whether you single pedal like Nirvana of double pedal like All That Remains. I highly suggest this kick-pad if you're looking for one that will last long and protect your bass drum from injury  =D
