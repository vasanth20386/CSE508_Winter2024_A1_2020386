Well I got my guitar a day after it was supposed to be delivered by ups, apparently they called all the drivers back at 7pm. So I got it the next day and it arrived with a broken neck it probably was broken by ups, I feel if they would of delivered it that night then they wouldn't have to unload/load it so much,more chance of it breaking. So I got a replacement and this one is almost perfect but for the volume knob on the guitar makes static when you turn it up or down. Now I knowvthat is a common problem generally on older volume pots but this is a brand new guitar. I'm hoping that it will get better with repeated turning.it still is an awesome deal with the amp and other stuff its a pretty sweet sounding guitar especially for what you pay for it.
