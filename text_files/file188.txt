i was expecting extreme brutality but got a pleasant surprise. this pup is super clean no. 1 and distortion is very smooth not at all what expected its warm in tone but has some bite to it. overall i really like this pup. to be honest I was expecting this pickup to be really mid focused but it has a tight punch in the low and the highs are not over bearing either. great pickup would get again!
