OMG! This is perfect ! I was hesitant to go drilling a hole in my Ukelele but wanted to have the option of amplification. This fit the bill with easy quick insallation ! No miss no fuss and it produces great ,clear wonderful sounds . I placed the pads in a triangular formation from the bridge down to the sound hole. I did take a tip from someone and got glued the solder joints on the piezos for added protection. 30 minutes total install time and that's cuz I have big club hands lol  . This is a true bargain quality piece comparable to the KK mini but about 80.00 $ cheaper .  In fact I used the KK installation video online to do the job . Highly recommended !
