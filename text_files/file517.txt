I was a little skeptical about this case but I went for it. It's for my rented violin that I just picked up. I travel for a living and looking for an alternative to the hard case the violin came in. This one is made of very high quality material, super light, and quality seems great. Fits the 4/4 like a glove and there's room for two bows, rosin compartment and an outer pouch that fits my shoulder rest. Comes with two straps that can make the case be used as a backpack, also came with the cloth to put on top of violin. Love it love it!
I got the black one btw
