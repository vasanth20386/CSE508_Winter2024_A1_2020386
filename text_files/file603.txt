Truthfully, I had no idea that the even were ukulele capos. But why not? I use them on guitars and banjo, and there are certainly times when you might want to shift key without transposing so you can take advantage of open strings.

Regardless, this is a well made, lightweight capo. Weight is of particular importance when dealing with an instrument that's already very small and lightweight, and hernally played without a strap. This capo won't make your soprano uke neck heavy. The soft rubber surface on the moveable jaw does a good job of pressing synthetic strings against a fret without stretching them out of tune. A useful tool for ukuleleists.
