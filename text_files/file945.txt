It works! This is a nice product I'm happy, however there are some things I noticed but nothing to take much away from the pedal, especially considering the low price.

Pros:

(out of 5 ratings)

*Great price: 5/5
*Sturdy build: 5/5
*Tunes accurately: 5/5 (I used this along with a reliable tuner app and they were both tuning simultaneously)
*Size and looks 5/5

Cons: (some people may consider these as cons)

(out of 5 rating)

*Tuning speed: 3/5 (you have to hit the string once to it for fastest: repeatedly hitting the string takes longer)
*Power source: 4/5 (Doesn't take battery, but any 9v adapter will work)

Overall product rating: 4/5
