Fit my 2007 MIUSA Strat which I purchased gutted and I'm slowly getting parts for. I just got the switch and machine heads and I still need the Pick-Ups. Since it's an 07 I felt that I could hot rod with out getting ostracized for it. I'm also going to do a hand carved inlay on the body. The guitar is being built for a give away to commemorate 19 years serving Indie Music. The image is a 1977 Fender MusicMaster MIUSA, the part I got is the same going on a Fender Strat
