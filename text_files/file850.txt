This is great sounding at a great price! Is it perfect? No, but it is no less perfect than something costing a lot more and not sounding as good as this pedal. I read one review in which the guy was not satisfied because he said it sounded like "80's glam rock." I totally disagree. If you can play and have a decent amp - you can get a variety of great sounds out of this little box. It seems like so many players like a fuzzy, buzzy type overdrive sound. I prefer a thicker creamy sound and you can dial that up with this pedal. For a mere $35, I was willing to roll the dice - I found a diamond in the rough.
