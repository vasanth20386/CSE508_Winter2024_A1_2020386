Perfect gauge for me. Easy to strum or pick with. Does not slip off my fingers easily. Previously I bought Fender's Medium picks, however they are too thin despite also labeled as Medium. I have also tried many other brands, but most of them are too slippery for me to grip on. These picks work best for me. Perhaps you should not choose color White like I do. It looks too plain and rather yellowish.
