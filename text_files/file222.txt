This is a first blush review and might not be helpful to readers outside of the United States.  I have plugged a variety of pedals into the JP-02 and all powered-up as expected.  The AC plug that goes into the wall or power strip is not designed for standard outlets found in the United States.  While this is not an inherent flaw, it is not stated clearly enough in the item description and I do not believe it can be seen in the photos.  JOYO does include a 2-prong adapter for use in the United States.  The adapter is much smaller than the power supply itself, which leaves the bottom of the power supply resting 1-5/8" away from the outlet (see attached photo).  There simply doesn't seem to be enough surface contact between the base of the power supply and the outlet.  A few trips over the power cord could easily compromise the integrity of the adapter, AC plug and/or your outlet.  I have not yet decided whether or not to keep this.
