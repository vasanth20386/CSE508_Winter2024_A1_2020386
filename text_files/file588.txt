Very awesome strap! It looks exponentially cool! Leather ends are supple enough to install to strap buttons easily. Strap itself is really soft, so it doesn't irritate your shoulders and neck while you're playing your guitar. It adjusts pretty easy to your desired length. Buckle is plastic. You may or may not have an issue with that. I personally didn't. It looks amazing, and that's putting it kindly. I've gotten many compliments on it already. Definitely worth the money. As a back story, I was born on the year of the Dragon, so it's only fitting I bought this strap.
