What luck that I received Dad's mandolin back from the luthier at the same time I was offered a trial of this mandolin strap in the Vine program!

It's nothing fancy - pretty much a strip of black leather about 3/4" wide - but mandolin players tend to be less visually flashy than, say, guitar or banjo players!

There are several holes on one end designed to fit over the button, then a tie on the other end to connect to the scroll.

I like it!
