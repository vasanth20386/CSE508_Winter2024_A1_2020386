These picks not only look good the are comfortable to use. The seem to have a rounded valley which leaves a raised edged. This helps to keep your finger on the pick and doesn't allow it to move around. In the close up picture you can see a slight curvature. This is the first time I have used these picks. I don't know how they will last but I will have fun finding out. It's a pick. You use it on a guitar. It's not complicated. I think its a very personal choice. But I have really enjoyed using these so far.
