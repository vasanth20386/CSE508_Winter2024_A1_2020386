These locking tuners look great and keep tune.  Good quality materials and construction.  Excellent upgrade to any guitar.  I had to drill additions holes for installation.  If your neck already comes with pre-drilled holes, then they should drop right in, otherwise you will need to buy a guitar tuner pin drill jig, also available from Amazon.
