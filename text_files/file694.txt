Pretty difficult for Boss to mess this up. Molded plastic box with plastic hinges and space for three pedals (see photos). In fact, if it didn't have the Boss logo pressed into it, this could just as easily be a case for a cordless drill. So long as you know what you are buying, youll probably be pleased.
