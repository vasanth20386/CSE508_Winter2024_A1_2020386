For the money they aren't bad but that doesn't mean they are good. Loud highs and lows get fuzzy and the over all doesn't sound great but for a small gig band or a backup Mics these are great! The only prob I have with them is that the mic mount doesn't fit on like any mic stand I have AND BUY A CHEEP POP FILTER FOR THIS MIC OR YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!!
