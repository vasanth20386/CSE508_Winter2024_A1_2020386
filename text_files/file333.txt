I LOVE this thing. It works as a VOLUME pedal, WAH pedal and EXPRESSION pedal, all in one. Also, the WAH sounds amazing. The small size of the top plate makes it a breeze to use and pull off all kinds of things that are much more difficult with a full size wah.  In short, it's built like a tank, sounds amazing and looks great :)
