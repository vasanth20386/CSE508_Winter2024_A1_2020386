The mixer has good build. Knobs, and sliders are smooth. Buttons click with no crackling. It is quite.. no hiss. (Unless turn pre-amps wide open). I'm not a big fan of RCA jacks..but it is portable. Best pick compared to other battery powered mixers IMO. Mixer is on top/left of pedalboard in the pics. I had to used RCA right angle adapters so would fit in the pedalboard case.
