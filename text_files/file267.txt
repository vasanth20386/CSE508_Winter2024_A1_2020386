(Review is based on using it with the PYLE PSMRS11 Acoustic Isolation Microphone shield, you can buy it as a package. I bought mine separately) It is one heavy duty mic stand, but I got it for holding up the PYLE PSMRS11 Acoustic Isolation Microphone shield and the damn shield was too heavy to hold in place!  It kept falling over. This mic stand was sold to hold the darn thing but it only works if you place the Isolation Shield in a certain direction (see picture). You must remove the rubber pads that are on the Microphone shield, if you don't you'll find your Isolation shield on the floor! The weight is too heavy for the rubber pads to hold them up (they are glued on). So you have to tighten metal to metal to hold the shield in place. You have to constantly check the tightening supports to make sure they don't pull the support stand down with it! You also have to remove the bottom metal desk supports from the Mic Shield to lighten the load on the Mic Stand. I hope this helps everyone using this for a Mic Shield.
