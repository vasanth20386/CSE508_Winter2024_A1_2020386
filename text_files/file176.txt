This is a good case bought the damaged box one for $30 less from amazon deals had minor and i mean minor barely noticable scratch $30 bux off this is a great durable case not as great as my road runner case but that one cost $125 bux and has a rough plastic molded shell

But this one rocks bought it for my 12 string bought another for this gretsch bigsby fits in there perfectly for $59 why spend $110 on a gretsch case... this case rocks
