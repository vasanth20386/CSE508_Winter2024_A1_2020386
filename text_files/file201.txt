Make sure to note the big old 'Xfinity' logo splashed across the front. This is fine for studio use, but the gigging musician should try to avoid giving away free advertising to the telecommunications giant and cover the logo with black tape.

Quality is fine, adjustability is strong. Just a little anoyed by the labeling. You know what doesn't say cool, edgy musician? Brought to you by Xfinity.
