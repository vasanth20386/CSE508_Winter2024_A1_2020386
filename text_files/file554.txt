They were perfect! Man i love them....
They were a little late in delivry as it was expected...
But once since they are on my jet gretsch....
It stay tune, fast change, no pain even with a bigsby....
I can even do "riff detuning" like they do in rockabilly music.
I wouldn't suggest them.... i would buy it as a gift!
