This is my second ukulele. I recieved this as a Christmas gift and I love it. It has very nice strings and has like mother of pearl tuning pegs. With my first uke I had trouble with the strings being hard to tune but right when I got this I tuned within 30 seconds and started playing. Also it comes with a chord chart and songs and a case.
