You really cant beat it for the price, however, I would not use it for really heavy lights. Its only rated for 50lbs anyway. If you have some LED fixtures, a couple lasers (attached picture).... then this is perfect. Heavy scanners, and other large format lights (even if only using one ~40 lbs) I would not use. It only feels secure enough for a couple smaller lights and a fogger. Just buy it!!! You could always use it in your entertainment center and or, mobile DJ rig for some sort of light application.
