The Amazon advertised pictures of this item is a Fender FTE3 pre amp. The description says it's a Fishman Isys III type. I googled it and found out there's two version of pre amp type of this T Bucket 300 CE series. The one I got today is a Fishman type pre amp which is for me much better that FTE3. Out of the box, I fell inlove with the color and design. Mine is a 3 tone sunburst. The action is just right for me. The tone/sound is awesome. I hooked it up in my Vox amp and I have to say this thing really rocks. Of course you can get a better sounding acoustic/electric guitar out there for a very much expensive price. I'm a family man with two kids and I am not gonna spend a thousand bucks just for a hobby. Amplified or not I love the tone of this baby. For it's appearance, sound quality, and of course THE PRICE, I'm giving it a five stars.

I uploaded some pictures (above) of the Fishman pre amp version of this T bucket series. :O)..
