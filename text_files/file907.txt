Squier Vintage Modified Jazz Bass.

If your reading this you already know all the major features so I won't dig into that.
This is an outstanding bass for the price...And even if it had a larger price tag it would still be an excellent choice.  The quality is excellent , it has great pickups and it sounds just as good as my Fender custom shop jazz.
Don't be fooled by the price,  you don't need to spend this month's rent on a bass to get an excellent instrument that is well beyond expectations.  Add a gator hard shell case and you have a super sweet jazz bass.
-EXCELLENT OVERALL QUALITY
-EXCELLENT FIT AND FINISH
-NO SHARP FRET EDGES
-GREAT STOCK DUNCAN DESIGNED PICKUPS ..EXCELLENT
-KILLER BASS AT TWICE THE PRICE
Highly Recomended. You will only note one major difference if you audition the squire jazz and the fender jazz side by side. ...the decal.
