This is a great idea and I was surprised at how well the suction cup adheres to my guitar's surface.  However, if you are going to rely on it for a gig, then I would attach at least two as your hand or any brushing against something firm can knock it off.  In other words, it isn't as sticky as adhesive.  But, for most situations, it certainly does the trick and can removed in an instant and does not deface the guitar surface in any fashion.  It does come with a medium thickness, pink pick that is halfway decent.  While I am not crazy about the color, I quickly realized that it is easy to see against the strings and surface of the guitar.
