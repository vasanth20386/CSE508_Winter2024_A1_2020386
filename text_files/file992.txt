These were perfect in every way for my application.  I installed these on a MIM stratocaster (I had to drill three holes in the tremolo plate to do so) and they were the correct NARROW string width ( 2 - 1/16" ) for my application.  I was even able to top-load the strings through the holes where the intonation screws originally fed through, just to piss off the purists.  It worked so well that I am doing the same modification to another of my import strats, but this time with graph tech saddles.  Those ones will work as well, but I have to sand off some injection mold flaws first (although that will be easy as well).  I'm a believer in either brass or graphite when it comes to the break-angles of strings and these were literally perfect.
