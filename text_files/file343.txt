Upgrading from a Numark Mixtrack Pro to this is night and day.  While I didn't buy it off amazon, I've attached my picture of the set up.  Definitely... buy a high quality flight case.  You don't want to haul a $1000 masterpiece and haul this in something that doesn't protect your investment.

I'm a hobbyist DJ.  I like messing around with different styles while not being dedicated to any one. This controller does it all. It does so much, I honestly think they should have online courses to use the more advanced features.  Sure you can run this right out of the box with cross fading and beat matching.  However that's not why you make this sort of investment.  You want to do something someone else can't. To make a sound unique and an audience captivated.  Worth... every.. dollar.

Sound, Lights, function, and every bit of it is Mona Lisa. There are 100's of Youtube reviews on this controller.  Do your homework. Watch them. It's your money and one person alone can't tell you how great this controller is.  You'll know when you experience it.
