This black guard fit perfectly on my squier affinity telecaster that I was doing my rendition of macawber(Keith Richards telecaster). Very impressed with how well it was made. I just had to file out the pickup hole just a little bit for it to fit with ease. But all mounting screw holes lined up and I didn't have to do any fit work that you have to do most of the time, even on more expensive pick guards sometimes. I am very happy with how it looks and fits, I do really like the matte finish of it too.
