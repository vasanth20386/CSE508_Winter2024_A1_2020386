Provided that this is not a Fender Telecaster but a Squier, I was pleasantly surprised by its playability and its tone. The three pick-up options make it very versatile for any type of music you may want to use it for. The difference in quality between this guitar model and the Squier by Fender Bullet Strat is incredible and well worth the $50 price increase.
