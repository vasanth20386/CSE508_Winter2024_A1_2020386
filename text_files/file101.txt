You can do a lot with this mixer. its great for podcasting. has 4 outputs that can be used to monitor, record, cue audio...The mute to 3/4 figure on every channel is fantastic and the three source switch to headphone/control room is a must for podcasting. Also has aux return inputs that can be used as extra stereo inputs and be volumed by the aux return knobs.

Only thing I didn't like about this mixer is the XLR outputs in back that require adaptors to use with RCA or 1/4 plugs. get the adaptors with it
