This is the second ChromaCast hard guitar case that I have purchased and I like both of them! I needed a hard case for my Schecter OMEN-6 guitar. I find myself playing this guitar more and more. I had bought a Schecter hard guitar case from Amazon Warehouse Deals but it didn't fit my guitar (the description said it would). I emailed ChromaCast and they said the CC-EHC case would work. It's a really nice case! It's a good value for the price. I saw the bad reviews for this guitar case and I can tell you that have not had a problem with either one of my cases.
