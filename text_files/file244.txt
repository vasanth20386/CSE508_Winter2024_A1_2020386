Hot damn!  I replaced the original neck position humbucker on my 1980 Les Paul (which I bought new) with a SPH90 Phat Cat.  What a difference!!  It is MUCH louder, and brighter, and all around sweeter and more tuneful that the original.  I used to rarely use the neck pickup alone.  Now I'll use it almost exclusively (though mixing in a bit of the bridge humbucker is sweet too).  I'm very glad I bought this and made the switch.  P.S. - I've had no problem with hum from this pickup - if you do, your problem is probably somewhere in your amp.
