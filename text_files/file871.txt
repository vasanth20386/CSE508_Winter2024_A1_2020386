I've been using these windscreens for years on all kinds of mics, and so has the entertainment industry. They block out wind noise and plosives without affecting the sound of the mic, not to mention the square shape is more visually-appealing to use on a mic like a Beta 87C than a ball-shaped windscreen. Speaking of ball-shaped mics, you can even get these to work on those. The proof is as easy to find as turning on your TV in the morning--under the A85WS on Wayne Brady and Jonathan Mangum's mics on "Let's Make A Deal" is a Beta 58A cartridge.

Shure has kept these windscreens the same since their inception for a reason: they're perfect just the way they are. Let's hope they never stop making these because they truly are the best and most-durable mic windscreen I've ever used.
