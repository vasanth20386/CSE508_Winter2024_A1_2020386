Great product and price. I bought these panels for a home studio, mostly for mixing a tracking as I don't do much live recording there. There is definitely a difference and the early reflections from the monitors are lessened (to my ears anyway). They did the job I needed and they look good too! I opted to pin them to the wall with t-pins instead of using adhesive. For my use it works well and I can remove them with little or no damage to the wall. I ordered a second box to put in a pattern on the one remain wall that could use some treatment.

If you are looking for acoustic foam absorption panels, take a look at these.
