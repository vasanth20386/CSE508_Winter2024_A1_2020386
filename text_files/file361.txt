Quality is questionable; had to glue brackets that the bridge screw into which raise and lower the bridge to the guitar body. Brackets were not properly set and had fallen out of the guitar during shipping. Some of the guitar strings were broken; it's fun to glue and restring a brand new guitar. Since the repairs the guitar is playing well and sounds ok; no string buzz or anything no thanks to Schecter or Amazons questionable shipping practices...
