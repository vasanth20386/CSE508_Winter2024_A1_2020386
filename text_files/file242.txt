Fits my AT2035 like a glove. It DOES cover the entire grill (see picture), just took a little careful finagling to get it on. As some reviewers have said, it does come in a little baggy pressed flat. Mine has expanded nicely in just an afternoon. Doubt if there's much better for my mic at the same price. Highly recommend.
