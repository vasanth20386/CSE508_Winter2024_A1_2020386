This was a gift from my sister and brother in law for babysitting there kids until school start. I have to say this is an Amazing Guitar. For 200$ it's worth the buy and if your new to 7 string guitars you'll love it. Well shipped and a well made guitar. I couldn't be any more happier with the White looks so sick.
