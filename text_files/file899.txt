This was a great value. The wood I received looked outstanding and all the parts were there and fit well. I did some customization to the look and added a couple of other pickups for some diversity but the components I received were of reasonable quality. The guitar looks and plays great after a bit of neck adjustment and setup. Very satisfied.

(Note: Like on most all of this type of low priced guitar, the volume pot was dismal. Why they don't spend a buck more for a decent volume pot that actually adjusts volume in a linear fashion is a mystery.)
