Another update. How can you sell these to people! I have a craft show this weekend and i went to put these tumers on and none id the screws fit! First one i didn't realize and it got stuck. I had to use two pliers to pull it off and scratched mlthe new neck i just finished making. Your company shpuld not be selling these! I now hqve to run out and find somewhere to but 6 sets ....Update....i ordered more, they came in odd. The top is too wide that the nuts don't fit!
Old review...I love the look of these and they came fast. I bought them for a cbgs ukulele. I wouldn't recommend putting them on a nice guitar. They skip a little.
