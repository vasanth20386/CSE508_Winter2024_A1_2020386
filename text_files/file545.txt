I have only had this pedal a few hours. It does what they say, maybe better than they say. I ran it through its paces with my Telecaster and was amazed. It can sound like the very costly Lesley pedals that go for near $400 but all that for only $50. I am happy, only 4 stars because I don't trust Behringer. I never had any of their stuff last that long.
