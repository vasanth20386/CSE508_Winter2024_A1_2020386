This microphone bundle was more than worth the price. The sound quality is excellent. The setup is relatively easy. I use it with a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 which already has phantom power built in. Put the gain at about halfway and it was good to go. Very pleased with it and will most likely be buying another one soon to add to my home recording studio.
