It worked well for about a month, and then broke too much to use.

Specifically, the metal part at the bottom of the arm, the one that slides into the clamp for the table, buckled and will not support the weight of the rest of the arm with a microphone.

I have 3 of these now, and all are showing the same kind of wear, but the one I use most frequently wore out the fastest, even though it was the newest, so I assume it's just a general useage thing, but I would have hoped it would last a year or so, not barely a month.
