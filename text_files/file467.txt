First of all the weight of the keys is absolutely perfect. Second I was hoping that the settings when you play softly or stabbed the keys where almost as accurate as a real grand piano. This is amazing. If you play softly, hitting the keys like a feather, it delivers the signal to the daw flawlessly. I was on a budget when I bought this, I was contemplating waiting for a more expensive one but needed it asap for a project. I'm very happy with this!

Now I use this in Logic Pro X with OS X El Capitan. I recommend using a midi cable to an input device via thunderbolt cable to your Mac. I've had issues with my daw crashing because it randomly connects and disconnects from usb peripherals. I'm sure Mac is gonna fix this but it's really annoying. I use a 28 channel thunderbolt connected mixer which works perfectly.

Don't buy a cheap midi cable. I bought one for like $7 and bent the pins on the first time I connected it!? Hosa or monster midi cables are great for this keyboard!

You will love this midi keyboard.
