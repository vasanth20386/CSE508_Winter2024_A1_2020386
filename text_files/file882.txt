Very high quality pickguard material at a great price. I make thinline partscasters and like to change the control positions from the "stock" location so I have to manufacture my own pickguards.

Short course:

Make a template. I use 1/4" MDF. Cut the pickguard blank a bit larger than the template. I use a scrollsaw with a spiral blade. Mount the blank to the template using double sided turners tape and press together. I use barbell weights for pressure and wait an hour before routing. I use a 1/4" Whiteside spiral flush trim bit on a router table to trim to size and a 45 degree bit to trim the edges at an angle. I use a plastic auto trim tool to separate the guard from the template. Helpful hint: lightly sand the sharpened edge before you slash yourself.
