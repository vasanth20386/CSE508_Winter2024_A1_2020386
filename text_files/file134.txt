I think that this is a great product (because it is for a complete keyboard), but I do have one tiny, tiny problem... They are so tiny that I can't see them.  I looked at many vendors for this type of product and because yours ran the full gambit, I chose it.  If you have any that are larger and has all 88 keys, I'll trade with you!
