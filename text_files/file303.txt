We used this one in the middle as seen in the picture holding the white guitar. BIG MISTAKE! The guitar almost was destroyed. This is NOT strong enough to hold a 7 string Schecter Omen guitar. While it worked out and seemed secure at first. Literally 7 days later the guitar had almost fell to the floor. I wouldn't recommend this for heavier guitars. Instead we will be keeping the guitar in the stand where it is safer.
