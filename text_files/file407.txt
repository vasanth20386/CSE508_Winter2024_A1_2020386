iT WOULD BE EASY TO BLAME THE GUITAR BUT sOME OF MY FELLOW MUSIANS HAVE TRIED IT WITH THERE GUITAR ANS SAME THING.. MOST PRO-NOUNCED ON THE HIGHEST STRINGS.. ALL THE STRINGS HAVE THE SAME VOLUME OR DYNAMICS. WHETHER I PLAY MY 335 OR MY SOUTHWESTERN. ACOUSTIC. THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME AS I BUSK SOLO.
  NOW THE GOOD NEWS, NOTHING ELSE TO COMPLANE ABOUT, MAYBE BATTERY LIFR.  I ALSO OWN THE STREET CUBE WITH TWO SPEAKERS,UMPTEEN EFFECTS.BATTERY LASTS ABOUT 3 TIMES LONG.
  PIEZO'S ARE FINICKY. I AM GLAD I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE ON A WHIM, I CAN GO TO THE BEACH AND WITH THE SOUND OF THE OCEAN COVERING MY COMPLAIN IT SOUNDS GREAT. oN A WHIM, i UPHOSTERED THE CUBE WITH LEAPORD SKIN THICK CLOTH.. SURE DOES GET MANY COMPLIMENTS ON  WHICH GIVES ME A BREAK FROM PLAYING!
