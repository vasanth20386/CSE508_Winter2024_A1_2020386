The kit shipped the following day from the distributor after my placing the order, arriving ahead of schedule. It took me a couple of hours to set it up and position the components to my liking. Adjusting the sounds, tones and volume of each device was rather straightforward. For the price, I am pleasantly surprised with the action of the cymbals and pads. Sounds great when recording as well. I highly recommend this kit for someone who doesn't want to spend a fortune, but would like a functional, professional-sounding electronic drum set that can take a beating and not take up a whole lot of space. I drum left-handed and placed everything accordingly. High-five to Acorn.
