This is horrible, poorly made stand. Chinese knock-off quality. Probably the worst quality hardware item I've bought in years, and I own many crappy Dixon cymbal stands. The wingnuts look like stock items in 1950's budget sets. The main tube OD is MAYBE 1/2". Just atrocious. If I were Mapex, I wouldn't put my name on this. I'd return it, but I'm only using it for a practice pad, so I guess it will do. Spend another $20 and get something decent.
