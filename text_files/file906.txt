Contrary to most of these reviews, the violin holds a tune quite well, you just have to tune it properly (i.e. push the pegs in as you twist them to create more resistance)

This thing came with an extra set of strings in addition to the ones on the instrument, and they even threw in an additional high string in case one breaks in tuning, make sure and sand off the top layer of rosin before you use it otherwise you'll die getting the bow ready for playing.

Most of the people complaining on here probably didn't set the instrument up properly before playing so don't pay attention to them, this is a great buy for an unbeatable price.
