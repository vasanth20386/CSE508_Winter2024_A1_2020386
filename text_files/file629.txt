I'd been searching for a while, to find a reverb pedal that would be able to fill the shoes of the built-ins that I'd used in the 60's and 70's... and here it is. Due to the unheard of low price, I half expected to get a "half fast" performance from this pedal, but fortunately, this was not the case. Upon plugging in the unit, and testing it with my Les Paul guitar, and my practice amp, I was amazed to hear how well this inexpensive pedal was able to replicate those old-school tones. This included emulation of multiple reverb types, such as  "spring", "plate", "hall", "gate", "room", and a really cool new one called "modulate" that throws a hint of chorus into it. Behringer not only got my money, but my respect and gratitude.
