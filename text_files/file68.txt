Its flimsy and for the awkward angles it sticks in a guitar the Vox device should be metal and sturdy, especially for price.  Mine broke within a week and I am a just a living room player.  I don't know how it broke but it did.  I will upload pictures.

Now aside of the cheaply made product it served its purpose for the time it lasted and provided sound through headphones,  but its better to get a portable amp.
