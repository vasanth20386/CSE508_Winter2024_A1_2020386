This case is awesome!  The molded interior fits my Fender Jazz Bass like a glove and I feel it's secured at all times.  This is the second case I've owned and the quality is superb!  It balances much better in my hand while carrying it than my last case which was a bit front heavy.  It's also lighter in weight than my previous case too.  The open compartment is deep enough to fit my cable, strap, tuner, accessories and I usually throw my amp power cable in there too.  I also like that the open compartment does not have a door that you always have to open or close.  Just open the case and everything is there for easy access.  Lastly, cosmetically this case is very sweet looking.  The black, white and chrome details are perfect and of course the chrome Fender logo on the top of the case really sets it off.
