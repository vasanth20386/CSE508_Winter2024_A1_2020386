Wow! This is a beautiful looking instrument, solidly made, with a nice rich and bright tone, and all for only 38 bucks! Worth every penny and more!

Addendum: After owning and playing this ukulele for a few months now, I am more and more in love with it. It has a better sound than my other more expensive ukes. I believe this is at least partly due to the larger sound hole. This gives it a brighter, happier, and louder tone. And for this price, you just can't beat this uke!
