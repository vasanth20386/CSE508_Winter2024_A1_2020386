These are great little stands. They are perfect for a "wherever you need it" stand. I have one next to my PC studio,making the guitar I'm using closer than my regular 5 guitar stand across the room ,and the other next to my bed (so i always have a guitar handy before and after i sleep ). These are really an amazing value and they hold guitars secure enough for me not to worry about them falling over...Holds my classical acoustics, stratocasters, and jazz bass perfectly....
