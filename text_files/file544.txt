Everything met my expectations the product was good quality, easy to install even without directions included and my guitars look great hanging on the wall. I read negative reviews saying that the quality was crap and it took them an hr to get it threaded onto the base. Unless you have no basic knowledge of being handy this will not be a problem just make sure you find a stud on the wall and screw the included screws through the drywall and securely into the stud. Before you do this  run the  screw that attaches to the base through the threads to avoid any issues like the negative reviewer had. After you attach the base to the wall thread in the guitar hanger screw firmly and you are good to go. I personally would easily buy one of these for the price of 2 they are great quality for the price and if you have more than one guitar to hang then this product is a must buy!!!!
