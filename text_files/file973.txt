Never lose your pick again. This is an essential item in your repertoire of gadgets for guitar players. I tried this almost on every surface I could possibly stick it to, and every time it worked great (except on dry wall...). Needless to say, this is designed for guitars, so any guitar you have, you can stick it to. No adhesive, no tape, no mess. Just press, and there you have it. Check the pics. I love Ernie Ball products, and this is another winner. Patent pending, made in China.
