Great replacement. 3 ply and made very well. As good as the Fender parts. NOTE: This is for the made in Mexico (MIM) or Fender American Standard Stratocaster. Please read all the specs on the website description. See a lot of people complaining it doesn't fit their Strat. Well it's because it wasn't made for their model. This will NOT fit a Squier or Roadhouse, Deluxe. Do your homework and you won't land up with the wrong pickguard.
