I could not imagine this product was so small but so powerful at the same time. I am using it in my analog mastering room, as a media reader. Especially interesting for the bluetooth connectivity. Connecting the output to one input of a Samson C Control studio controller, and there you go... send the sound wherever you want to direct it in the studio.
