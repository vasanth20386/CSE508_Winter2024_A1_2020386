I'm actually impressed by this mic.  For the price, assuming yours works out of the box, you can't really go wrong.  I bought two for podcasting and plug them directly into my mixer and the sound quality is excellent.  They seem well made (time will tell) and, again, the price was excellent.  Heck, they even look good.  :)
