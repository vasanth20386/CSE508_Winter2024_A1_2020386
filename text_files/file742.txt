Ordered a "MUGIG" tuner, but received one with a "Musedo" brand mark. (See photo) Who is "Musedo", anyway?! I'm sure I'm correct in my assumption that these inexpensive tuners are mass-produced in China and receive all manner of brand name logos on them.

Also, due to package being labeled "Lithium Battery Enclosed", this Amazon Prime item took 7 full days to arrive... Not the usual 2-day Prime shipping.

Aside from these two issues, this $9 tuner seems to work as well as my $20 Korg TM50BK.
I purchased it because the price was so low that I thought it couldn't hurt to have an extra tuner lying about the studio.
I plan to order another to donate to our church's music dept.

For those interested, this tuner w/included clip-on mic does indeed fit in the same co2CREA case made for the Korg TM50BK tuner:
ASIN: B01F8IMXVC

Nice little tuner at a nice little price.
