Just installed two electrosockets. My Classic Vibe 50's Tele went perfect. I left the retainer clip in inserted the washer and nut to secure then tightened the plate and screwed in place. On my Fender l ended up removing the retainer clip put the washer in place and tightened and screwed the plate in place.
