Purchased after studying the reviews on quality, which is accurate for this mount. It timely arrived. The center mike holder opening is for a much larger microphone than the ATR 2100, that I own. The 2100 indicates 51mm, but that is at the mike area, not the trunk which is much smaller and used for mounting to the shock mount. After researching a replacement in the same price range, I found none. I had some foam pipe insulation for 1/2 inch pvc pipe in the utility room. This is readily available from most any big box hardware store.  I cut the foam about 4" in length and placed the 2100 in the foam. It fits perfect. I didn't seal the foam, but it is just right and tight in the mount holder. I now have a shock mount that can be used if, and when, I purchase a larger microphone. I have attached a photo. After the image was created, I further trimmed the foam length to match the actual size of the mounting holder opening.  This shock mount is a quality product at a great price.
