Great cable for the money.  The 90 degree connectors are excellent to minimize the strain on acoustic guitar jacks.

***Edit***
I have changed this rating from 5 stars to 2. The 90 degree connectors are poorly built. They are pressed together and easily break apart. I believe the connection on the 90 degree end is also the culprit for occasional noise. The straight ends seem to hold up well though.
