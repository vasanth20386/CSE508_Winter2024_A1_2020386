Over the period of a month, one of the two cables failed. When I unplugged it, the actual quarter inch end broke off as I was pulling the cable out as I normally do at the end of practicing or a show, and got stuck in my amp so thanks to this, I have to spend money and time that I don't have to get my amp fixed with the broken cable and buy a better, stronger, more durable cable that won't break when I pull it out of the amp.
