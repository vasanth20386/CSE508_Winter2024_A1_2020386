Just upgraded to this board and I am very happy I did. I needed more stereo inputs and this one had 4 of them. When it comes to an internet radio station you need a clean quiet board. I have no noise coming out of this board so I am very pleased. Plus I needed the AUX outs for my TelosONE set up. Everything is working perfect!
