So out of all the Tube Screamers I've had, this is the first to say "Maxon" on the outside. I have a TS9DX and TS9 that were made for Ibanez by Maxon in the 90's that were modded to 808 spec, and this pedal sounds dead-on to that sound.

The sound has been kind of a blanket statement of "transparent light to medium drive". Like any Tube Screamer, this has a great drive on its own, can push an overdriven amp without adding color, and can stack well with other pedals. It's definitely a smoother overdrive than other Tube Screamers or clones I have.

The pedal I'd compare this to the most would be the Ibanez TS808, obviously. The sounds of the 2 pedals are very similar, but the OD808 is a little smaller, has a normal stompswitch, and costs a little less than the TS808 Reissue. This is definitely the real deal by the company that's been making Tube Screamers longer than anyone else. Definitely one of my favorites along with the Electro-Harmonix East River Drive.

Bottom line; the Maxon OD808 is what a Tube Screamer should sound like.
