Just got this today and I was pleasantly surprised by the whole package!  Well made case, legs and instrument.  This is my 2nd lap steel, my first was a Recording King.  I'm as pleased if not more because my RK did not have the screw on legs and has a better case and was a bit cheaper.  I will buy another in the future!
