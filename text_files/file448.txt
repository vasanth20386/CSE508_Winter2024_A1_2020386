This is now the second pop filter I have purchased of this brand, and there has been one significant upgrade that I am jealous that my previous purchase of item didn't have. I have been setting up two separate recording PC's at home, and my son wanted a similar setup as I had. The first filter I had purchased still works and I liked its ease of use. I was pleasantly surprised to see the one thing I disliked about mine had been changed.
It now has a branded logo or name on the face plastic surrounding the mesh screen. It's a little thing, but the simple addition of it makes for a cleaner Item. I would have liked to have seen a different mounting solution for mounting it to a mic setup, as the current thumb screw is just a bit too short to mount to the boom arm spindle on which my mics shock mount attaches to. Overall, this filter is serving its purpose well.
