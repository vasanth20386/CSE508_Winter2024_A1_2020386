At first I hesitated because $30 seemed a lot for a mic stand but I decided to just keep the order. It came in about 4 days immediately and I set it up. Wow the quality is amazing. It extends pretty high and far. I was worried at first it would be too small but it soon proved me wrong. There are no flaws. I will definitely order another one soon for my second mic. This product was great and there's a reason this was rated 5 Stars. Great for home studio budgets. Highly recommend!
