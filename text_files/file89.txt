Having a blast!  Never played before today. Took abou an hour and a half to put together. Had to use a LARGE slotted screw driver to ease the clamps open to accept posts with a bit of a twist of the screw driver; once in, they slid all the way in with a bit of help with a few taps of a rubber mallet.  Now it's all together and very snug. Other than that it was an easy paint-by-number set up. The initial sound is great. I'll have to tweak cymbal #3 - (ride) it seems a bit quiet when I hit it. But hitting the button on the head comes out full and loud. So I'll figure that out eventually. Of course that only happens on some of the different kits to choose from. Anyway, from a tenor saxophonist's first time on a full drum set, this is fantastic!
