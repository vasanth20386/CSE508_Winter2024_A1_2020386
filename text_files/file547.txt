Bought these for my Peavey Raptor Plus EXP that I'm currently rebuilding. The screw was a bit longer than the one that was for the original string tree, so it took a bit longer and had to use a little bit of elbow grease to fully get it screwed it. But once it was tight, it looks great and matches the rest of the gold hardware on the guitar. I would recommend this to anyone looking to build a Partscaster, upgrade the string trees, or do as I'm doing and getting all gold hardware for their guitar.
