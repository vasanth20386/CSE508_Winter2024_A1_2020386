While I wasn't sure this would fit my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9, I was pleasantly surprised. Whats impressive is how secure my iPad feels in the grip of the two sets of prongs.

Unfortunately, the product will not hold an iPad 12.9 with a book-type case, but it is fine with my silicon shell case. The claws snap onto the iPad perfectly.

I found a way to make the iKlip super useful. When detached from my instrument stand, the clamp assembly serves as a highly stable, adjustable kick stand.

Mounted on a mic or guitar stand, It is quite adjustable, and a channel in the socket adjustment lets the arm point all the way to the floor.

The clip holds the iPad so snugly that I would trust it in portrait mode even though the clips would be holding your device from the sides.

Overall, an excellent product. I just wish that the claws were less shallow so that I could include my book-type case. But since it does accept a thin shell, and its still portable around my house with the kickstand solution, Im satisfied.

FYI, last pic is with shell case.
