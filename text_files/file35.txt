Thus should be a 5 star review, but sadly, it's only a 3. I bought a cymbal off of eBay that was a mess. I got it for next to nothing and figured I would clean it up. Cleaner sure worked well and then THANKFULLY I read to not use on the Letters. Holy cow I was this close to cleaning up those areas when thankfully someone called me and I read the entire bottle to the very end.

So the finished product is what you see. A far better cleaned up cymbal but still looks like a wreck around the Letters. Oh well. Light years better than the eBay mess I bought. But I sorely wish I could clean around the lettering with no fear of losing the lettering. You would think Zildjian would be able to make a cleaning product that works well around the Letters, no?
