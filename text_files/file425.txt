A great product if you need to connect a guitar to a computer or other USB compatible recording device. The cord is incredibly well made. I would say this is for home-use or hobby recording. It would be wonderful to be used to save song ideas or songs in the making. The connections work just fine and are well made. The cord is nice and long so it's comfortable to sit or stand and play and not feel too attached to a computer. The connection points are nice and sturdy so they won't break. If you are in the market for one of these types of guitar cables, I do recommend this one.
