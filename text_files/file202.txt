This Singing Bowl is perfect for just taking a few minutes out of each day while listening and feeling the songs. I was not surprised at the smaller size of the Bowl but I was surprised by the excellent quality and tone of this Singing Bowl. it is a true instrument that begs to be played.
I plan on a couple of other Bowls in the near future to enhance a rather growing set of metal and ceramic bowls I have.
For a beginner to Singing Bowls, creating your first song is simple just follow the instructions and take a few minutes to watch thier video of getting started.
