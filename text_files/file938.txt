I find this unit adequate, I use it with my MacBook as part of a portable 'winter' studio. I also own a Scarlet 2i2 (Gen 1)  which I use in my primary studio  I find the 2i2 has superior sound quality  less audible distortion / lower noise  and I prefer the 2i2's Neutrik style XLR/TRS output connector. The Behringer is a good value  it works fine and has good features / performance for the price  but like other Behringer products I've used, the sound quality / noise / distortion, leave me wanting a better product. If features or budget are at the top of your list, this product should do the job; if however sound quality is of primary importance then I'd recommend the Scarlet 2i2 (look for sales or a used Gen 1).
