Overall I'm happy with the stand.  I admit I was scratching my head a bit when I was putting it together.  There's more pieces to this stand than others I've had.  Adjusting it is a little bit of a pain because there are 4 different areas that you can loosen and change around.  If you travel and gig a lot, you may want to go with the higher model, the adjustments look a bit easier.  However once all setup, it's sturdy and well built.

FYI the stand shown currently is not the same design as the one I received.  I uploaded a picture of the one I received from this order page which has a separate arm piece that inserts into the main stand.
