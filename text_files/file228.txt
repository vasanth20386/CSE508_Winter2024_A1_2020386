The way these are shipped all scrunched up may make you nervous, but don't worry. They'll be fine.

One thing to note, per the product description:
"High Quality Multi color foam for ball shape microphones."

Somehow I missed that line before purchasing. These will fit nicely on an SM-58 or other handheld mic with a ball-type grill. They will slide right off an SM-57 or similar shaped mic. That's not a defect, just something you want to know. But at ~$2.00 for a five-pack, I have zero complaints.

And they WILL work on a straight shaped mic with the aid of a hair-tie, rubber band, gaff tape, etc. For size reference, see pic. I have the blue one on an SM-57. I even managed to get the yellow one to stretch over a Sennheiser e609 (this is of questionable usefulness, since it's pretty much exclusively an instrumental mic, but I figured I'd see if I could). They also fit well on my condenser mic (second pic), though they aren't as substantial as the foam cover that came with it.

All in all, would highly recommend these.
