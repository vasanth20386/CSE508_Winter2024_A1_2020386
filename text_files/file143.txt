Arrived 3 days after I ordered it, the bent welding should've clued me to what would happen. 2nd time I tuned it the inferior quality tension bolts started stripping, making the macho (small drum) useless. Mostly good materials (oak, steel, rawhide) + terrible craftmanship = drum being returned. Lay down another $30 and get some Aspires, I've gotten 2 sets of those (1 for me, 1 as a gift) and they won't let you down, or you might want to check out similarly priced bongos from Meinl, Gon Bops or Tycoon, but avoid this hunk a junk.
