I first considered the Cordoba concert ukulele because it was on every list of the best beginner ukes, and I am so happy with my choice! It took about a week to stretch the strings and stay in tune, but the Cordoba sounds amazing. My daughter has a cheaper soprano uke and the Cordoba has a noticeably clearer sound and is much lighter weight. It just feels great in my hands. I tried some no-drill straps, but ultimately chose to add a strap button with no problem. I saw some reviews about quality control issues on the finish, and I did find a rough spot on the back (see photo). This was not an issue for me, but I'd suggest checking for this. Otherwise, I love everything about my Cordoba ukulele and highly recommend it for beginners. From my experience so far, it's worth spending a little more to get a quality instrument.
