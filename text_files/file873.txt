When you buy aftermarket pickup rings, lining up the mounting holes is a concern... however, these lined up perfectly with the holes on my Dean Schenker V.  They are for a flat-top guitar, so if you try to mount them on a Les Paul, which is arched, you'll have problems.  Make sure the pickup rings you order are for the right type of top.

These fit perfectly, and even came with nice mounting screws.
