I'm a long time musician, and a long time user of Ernie Ball Strings (on electric guitars). Unfortunately, I can't endorse these strings, even though they sound great and the light gauge saves my fingers. The problem is that they break, in my humble opinion, excessively easily. I put a set on and broke a g string within 2 days of moderate use. It snapped near the saddle, so I didn't think much of it. I replaced the set, and within a few more days I noticed that the wrapping on the g string was broken and becoming unraveled near my third fret. I bought 7 sets, so I still have 5 more sets to go through, but honestly I'll probably go back to elixirs when these are gone, since they seem to last longer.

*update*
I purchased these strings on 12/19. It' now 1/18, and I've broken 3 strings from 3 different packs.
At this point, I really hate these strings.
