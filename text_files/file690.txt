Blends beautifully with the chrome tonearm, and includes the 4g weight which is easily removed.  I am using in conjunction with an Ortofon 2M Red on a 1200Mk2.  Excellent results.  Somehow, although the output level is rated the same between my previous setup (Concorde cartridge with Ortofon Night Club stylus, 5mV spec), I am now getting a proper output level through my preamp, whereas the previous cartridge/stylus was at at least 6dB lower.  Weird.  Tried two different model stylii on the other headshell, another headshell altogether, and they both gave the same result.
