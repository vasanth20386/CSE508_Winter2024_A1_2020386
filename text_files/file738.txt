This desk stand is small enough to easily fit inside my field bag, doesn't weigh much, and does its job effectively. Although it is small, it is still able to sturdily hold my RODE NTG2 microphone without danger of tipping over. Clipping the long microphone to the stand at the very end of the shotgun is a little precarious but I have made it work. It probably helps that the rode screw-on is very heavy, allowing the center of balance to be closer to the center of the stand.

Anyway, I like that i can carry this around. It's very compact, light, and can still do its one job. For the price, an excellent buy.
