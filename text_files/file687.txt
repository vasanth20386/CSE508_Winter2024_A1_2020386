This is my 2nd Donner DP-1. The first was purchased to replace a noisy daisy-chain supply. Ran 8 effects, including the Line 6 DL4 (with the reverse polarity adapter) without any noise, power interruptions, or channel failures. From what I understand (after a lot of reading/research), these seem to be independent channels, but share a common ground. I'm not an electrician, but I do know that whether I'm running through my amp at home, or through the PA at church, I'm getting zero noise. Quite content with these.
