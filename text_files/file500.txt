Outstanding case!  My H6 fits into this case perfectly.  It is made of heavy duty plastic, which is at least twice as thick at the case that comes with the H6.  Each cut-out within the foam interior is custom sized to fit your H6 and all of the accessories.  The latches are very sturdy.  See picture to get a sense of the size in relation to the standard H6 case.  BUY IT...
