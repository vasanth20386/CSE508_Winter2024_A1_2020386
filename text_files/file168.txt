Installed these in my Ibanez  AS53 with no problem.  Probably not the application intended by the mfg, as they are intended to replicate active metal pickups. The Neck pickup is pretty dark, and lacks volume and clarity. The bridge pickup is louder, and brighter than the neck. I've had both better, and worse pickups... these are just alright. If I had it to do all over again, I probably would have just left the stock pickups in the guitar. It's not worth sending back, as the product does actually work, and tone is such a personal and subjective thing. I'm rating three stars as a neutral rating.
