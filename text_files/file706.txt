This thing kicks some serious butt. An excellent, deep, thumping subwoofer. It really rounds out our sound. The first day I got it I ended up with a sheriff in my front yard asking me to turn it down. :)

Every time I order something from Audiosavings, I am floored at how quickly they ship the item. This was no exception. The sub-woofer was on my doorstep 2 days after I ordered it. That's faster than Amazon Prime in most cases. The outer box was damaged, but Rockville packages these things so well with an inner package of thick styrofoam that there was *zero* damage to the subwoofer itself. Kudos to whoever packaged these things.
