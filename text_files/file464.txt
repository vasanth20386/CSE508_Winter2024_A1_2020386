Very happy with this baritone ukulele. I have been wanting to try one since I also play guitar. There was a little buzzing but raising the bridge a tiny bit solved the problem. Also upgraded the tuners just because I had some nice silver ones on hand. .  The sound on this uke is wonderful. Can't go wrong with this beauty.
