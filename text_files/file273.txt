I've been playing ProMark 747s for decades....  because my wife likes Porcupine Tree and Gavin Harrison (so do I), she surprised me with a pair of these and I was blown away.  Great grip and great feel.  I've never played with grippy anything but I sure do love it.  I did finally break the pair after some time and it's time for a new pair....  I just with I could roll them on a flat surface to be sure they're STRAIGHT and not warped which I've been bitten by before with online stick purchases.  Here they were before breakage.
