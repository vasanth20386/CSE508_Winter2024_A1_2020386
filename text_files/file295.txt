I would give this 2.5 stars. The reason they disappointed me somewhat is that the squares have a degree of variability to them. See my picture. Some are taller than others, some are more grey others more black. And even after sitting a few days there were still dents in them. They worked but after buying 96 of these I wanted more uniformity.
