I was afraid to order this after reading so many bad reviews about holes not lining up. So I have to weigh in and say that it fits my 1994 Black Label Fender P-Bass perfectly. It was a tight fit, but after some wiggling and strategic pressing around the pickups, it finally sat down. My original pickguard was an off white (originally white, but it aged), on a cream/off white body. I wasn't a fan of the look, so I got the Tortoise Shell color. See my photo to see how it turned out!

OH! One thing to note: the pickguard came slightly warped. I think it was because the Amazon delivery driver had the envelope package on his hot dashboard in 100 degree Texas weather. I don't blame the manufacturer for this. I put the pickguard between two heavy pieces of glass and left it outside for a couple hours to get it to lay flat. No problemo.
