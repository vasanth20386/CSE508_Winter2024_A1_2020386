Great nylon strings, just as expected. They worked just fine on my daughter's mini classical guitar. They are as good quality wise as much more expensive strings I've purchased in the past. They are much softer to the touch and easier for her to learn on than my steel strings on my acoustic guitar. They came labeled with both the note name and the string number, which made putting them on easy and quick.
