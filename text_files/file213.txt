First of all i would say that for the price, this is something you don't want to let pass. Dont be fooled for the size, these lights are just more than bright. I had some problems with one light out of 4, but customer service was able to help me asap. DMX controls, they work amazing. I would highly recommend these lights to anybody.  In the picture i added i have just one of them lights in purple, wich i used on for the floor.

Once again i reordered these lights and not just exceeds my expectations, but the take it to a whole new different experience. For the price you are not just getting a simple light, you are getting high quality light. They work just awsome with dmx programing, the features on the light it self are just beyond awsome. From strobe, to fade and sound activated feauture, they are just perfect.
I used them with dmx.
The light output its just bright, bright enough to get you right on you eyes and make you "blind" for a couple seconds, if looking directly at them.

So i highly recommend them to anyone.
