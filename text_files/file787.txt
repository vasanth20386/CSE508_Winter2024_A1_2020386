For a cheap, off-brand instrument, it plays excellently and resonates very well. The bass feels very sturdy and looks fantastic in person. It definitely needs better strings, but what new instrument doesn't? I haven't tried amplifying it, and I honestly don't plan to, as I only wanted it for the acoustic properties to practice without having to drape myself in cables. The neck is comfortable, the body is well-assembled, and having two strap buttons opposed to the usual single one on most acoustic basses is a welcome feature. The bridge is also very nice: the last acoustic I had, I kept losing bridge pins, so not having to deal with those was a main drawing point for this bass for me.
