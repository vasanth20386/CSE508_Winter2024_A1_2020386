Awesome quality for the price. I did replace the foam protecting covers with thick rubber, but that's more personal preference than a quality issue. The price for this stand is outstanding. I bought two more, and now have three in all. I keep one at my practice space as well. These stands are completely trustworthy with any standard guitar styles. A flying V, or Dimebag Model, or even an Explorer may not work with these. I am quite satisfied with mine.
