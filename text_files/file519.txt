I love this guitar! I honestly never held a Squire brand strat before, but compared to everything I've held, played, and heard in the past; this guitar really gives you the best bang for your buck. Especially if you're like me and pretty much poor as dirt. I thought that with this guitar being so cheap I'd probably want to get some small upgrades, but I'm pretty content with what I got after the first 10 minutes of playing.

I recommend this guitar to pretty much anyone that wants a strat of incredible quality and price.
