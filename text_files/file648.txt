This is an excellent little stand.  The adjustment for angle is easy to do, and the construction is robust. Quite roadworthy!  It fits my Mesa-Boogie Subway Rocket perfectly, and holds it at just the right angle to make the most of my little amp.  The Boogie is no lightweight either. It is a handbuilt, all tube point-to-point American-Made amp in a robust case.
