Not bad at all for the price.  Cheaper on Amazon than ebay.  Installation was straight forward after watching some youtube videos.  I would watch out for the EXACT shape when cutting the holes in the body.  The larger piece has a couple of 'clipped' corners that need to be left on the body for the screws to grab.  Sounds great and the tuner is accurate.
