If you want some fun or you are having a down day (and who doesn't some times)...just get this! It is so much fun. Turn on your favorite music and turn this on by simply plugging it on a wall outlet and watch the light show - just fantastic, if you like bright colorful lights. The colors vary and change depending on the sounds from your own music. These are LEDs so very little electricity is used. You can place this table top or hang it on a wall.
