Got the Super 55 Deluxe for my wife to use when rehearsing in home studio. She was using a $100 Sennheiser E835 Dynamic Cardioid and *hated* it so I decided to fix that situation. With no change other than plugging in the Shure Super 55, adjust input trim on mixer and some minor EQ, the difference in her voice was remarkable. Very even and consistent response across vocal frequency range. Some presence enhancement,  subtle and helps vocals punch through mix. Another reviewer mentioned the Shure Super 55 may have some compression characteristics -- I agree and it's a good thing; she is able to get right up to the mic, soft or screaming, it doesn't peg the meter (much) on my board. Another thing is that she *loves* the look of the Super 55 Deluxe; puts her in the mood for that 40's/50's jazz stuff she does so well :) Overall - we are very happy with the Super 55 Deluxe and I will probably get a second one for myself soon.
