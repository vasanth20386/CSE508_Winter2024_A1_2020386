My oldest son plays and owns many guitars. He asked for a new guitar strap for Christmas. I ordered this one because we are Irish and I thought it looked really cool.

The guitar strap has held up very well and my Son says it's comfortable and easy to adjust.

Very happy, that he is happy with his new guitar strap.

I purchased this guitar strap at full price. All opinions and photo's are my own. I am providing this review for anyone considering the purchase of this item. Thank you!
