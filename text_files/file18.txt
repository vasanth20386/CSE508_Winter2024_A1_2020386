This Gator guitar hanger is sturdy, attractive, and easy to install.  It comes with wall anchors for drywall, and long screws.  The hangers are rubber coated to prevent finish damage.  The instructions are simple and I had this installed in under 5 minutes.  There are no screws visible once the unit is on the wall.  I was initially worried that the guitar would hang too close to the wall, however it is a good 3.5" away.  It did take some "oomph" to get the actual hanger prongs parallel to the floor, but it certainly feels solidly locked in.  I was fortunate enough to have a location where a stud was available (and I would highly recommend using a stud for the install), however 2 heavy duty screw-in wall anchors also come with the unit for drywall mounting.  I much prefer this clean look to having the guitar on a floor stand in the corner where it tends to gather dust and dog hair. Ugh.
