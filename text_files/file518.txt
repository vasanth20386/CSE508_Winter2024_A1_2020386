This stand is great. Its light weight and sturdy base when extended to 9ft. It has screws for 8 lights so you can fit any size light on the T-bar. I have an Eliminator Lighting Katana LED, on one side and it takes up about 3 of the screw locations. You can fit a single projector light on this stand if you remove the T-Bar. Pictures show a close up of the screw that hold the t-bar/projector light.
