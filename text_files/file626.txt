Just installed my new pick guard and trem cover.  Looks great and fits perfectly on my Squier Classic Vibe Strat.  The only problem is that a Classic Vibe Strat comes with an 8-hole pick guard, and this one has 11 holes.  Good thing is that the 8 existing holes lined up with 8 holes in the pick guard, and I had to drill the remaining three holes.  But since the pick guard was installed already I knew exactly where to drill them.

My Classic Vibe guitar came with a bright-white, thick, single-ply pick guard.  It was really kind of ugly and cheap looking, but with the new one it's a lot easier on the eyes.

Highly recommended.  I've tried other Musiclily products and so far have never had any problems with quality or fitment.
