The Pedaltrain is a bit pricey, but it keeps everything well organized and I have room for a few more pedals. I don't gig, but the board is solid and light, and the soft case seems sturdy enough for someone who will travel with their pedals. I purchased industrial strength velcro to mount my pedals, and i mounted my Donner power supply to the bottom of the board using velcro with no issues. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase, and my wife is happy that the area in front of my amp is no longer a rat's nest of cables and daisy chained pedals.
