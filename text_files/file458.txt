I have nothing bad to say about this stand. It works and it gets the job done. I use it at home,  and I have placed it in a corner of the room with 3 electric guitars, one acoustic, and one bass.

The instructions were just a picture but I got it assembled in less than 10 minutes. Really easy to do.

Great multi guitar rack/stand for the price. I definitely recommend.
