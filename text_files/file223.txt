Love the blue glow of the power supply on my pedal board.  I've only had it for a day so I don't know how it will hold up, but i'm sure it will be fine.  Comes with all of the cables to fully power your pedal board.  The A/C adapter cable is only 3 feet long so consider buying an extension chord or power strip to plug it into.
