Brilliant!!,should've got more!,a pic?,well,I use V Picks,and as you know,keeping ONE plectrum around for "ever"?,yeah,so despite the many little boxes,key rings etc..ya lose em in no time!,but,they DO stick to your fingers and also I wish they made them SQUARE!,so you can know where the Tip is,(some picks are huge,so,which corner?,and are you hitting the flat part,so yeah,a teardrop shape?,but they work and that's that,and I probably will get em again,So 5 stars,and it shipped in no time,I've seen em,but grab a pack,it's really cool not to have to look or feel around if your holding you're pick right,in the heat of a gig or even at home recording,a slipping pick just as you hit you're groove is damn annoying!,anything that helps stop that is cool!
