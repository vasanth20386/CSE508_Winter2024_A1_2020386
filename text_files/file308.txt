Well built, all metal construction, It's capable of holding 6 and possibly 7 smaller mics if you use the center mounting hole that goes over the mic stand, you can use a mic clip to hold the bar instead of the washer / nut. I use it to hold 4 large diaphragm condenser mics with shock mounts. It keeps me from having to swap mics for different vocalists when recording.  I just position the pop filter in front of the mic that is being used and mute the unused ones.  Sometimes I'll actually leave the other mics on and record the simultaneous vocal takes across several mics to separate tracks. This gives me several "flavors" to add effects to without having the vocalist do individual takes on different mics.  It saves a lot of time when choosing a mic for a particular vocalist.
