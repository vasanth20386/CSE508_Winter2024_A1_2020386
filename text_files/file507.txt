I have a Makida cordless I use over and over to not only install, but to set up an even torque to start tuning. Mine has a high and low speed.
Step 1: I set to the lowest setting and use a star pattern to seat the head.
Step 2: Raise torque to 2 or three and repeat until you hit you desired pitch. I use a lower speed for this. Tap each point to double check the pitch as you may have a tight thread.
Step 3: Bottom or resonant heads are often thinner and don't require as much toque. Repeat from step one until you hit the desired tension. Some drummers match the pitch, others raise or lower it a 3rd from the batter side.
***Snare resonant heads are a different animal. Set your top head pitch and dial in the bottom to the tone or snare response you desire: flat, crisp,fat,etc.
