Installed these humbuckers on my Epiphone Les Paul Standard. The sound of the neck and bridge humbuckers are very similar. The bridge just has a tad bit more treble. However, both of these HBs produce a very, very warm sound. When playing with an MXR Distortion + it produces a grunge/fuzz sound but keeps clarity of each note. The clarity is outstanding on the HBs-each note can be heard. The HBs are not very versatile, only producing a grunge/fuzz sound, regardless of what distortion pedal I use but it fits my playing style at the moment so I am very happy with them.
