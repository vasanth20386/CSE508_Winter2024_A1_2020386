I've had this tuner for about 4 years and it's been great. It tunes fine. For a long time the tuner just sat in my room, but recently I started taking the tuner around to practice and transporting it in my bag. Unfortunately one of the 3 plastic pieces where the gooseneck attaches to the tuner broke off. It still works but the head sometimes falls off of the tuner. Now I'm looking for a clip on tuner that is a little more durable. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know.

I've added a photo that shows where one of the plastic pieces is missing (so you can see the joint)
