The cheap black screw broke.

I drilled a starter hole just a hair smaller diameter than the supplied cheap black screw. It broke off manually trying to screw it into the bottom of an acoustic guitar. I was able too clamp a Vice Grip to the broken end, clamp it, and screw it out. Fortunately, I had a neck button with a stainless steel screw to replace it. I installed it but not with the cheap black breakable screw supplied.
