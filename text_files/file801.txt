I got this to replace the bridge pickup on my squire strat. I was skeptical that it would really make much difference, but my feedback problem was solved, and the tone is much warmer and cleaner (the old pickup was just awful). I read comments saying that the green wire goes with the red and the white is hot. Mine came with the red wire as hot, and I didn't change that. It works, and it definitely sounds like a beige pickup is supposed to, so it think you should just trust whatever setup the factory gives you. Also, I know other people explained this, but many said they had to enlarge the pickup hole to accommodate the pickup. You DO NOT. It takes a bit of patience but if you are careful, you can slip it in with no modifications.if you are looking to upgrade a cheap guitar, you should be pretty well satisfied with this pickup.

P.s. this is the first thing I ever soldered, and I suck at everything. If you are thinking about changing a pickup but don't think you can do it right, anything I can do, you can do better.
