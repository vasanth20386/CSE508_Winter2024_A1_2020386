I really like the simplicity of this bridge. It adjusts easy for string height and length. It comes with all the mounting screws and even a small allen wrench to make the height adjustments. The provided mounting screws are Phillips head screws. The one thing that I missed when I ordered this was the fact that it is not a bridge for string-thru the guitar body placement. The strings dead end to the stop-flair of the plate. I included a picture of this so it may help to make others aware that it is not for string-thru applications. No biggie tho for me, I will use it on another project now.
