This case is rigid yet lightweight. There seems to be plenty of padding (high density Styrofoam?).  In regards to the various sizes, I bought the "Electric" size and it fits my new Fender Strat perfectly.  A Fender Strat fits snugly without shifting around.  NOTE:  If you have a Les Paul style guitar, make sure to buy the "Les Paul" case.  If you buy this Electric case, which is what I am reviewing here,  your Les Paul will NOT fit!  Inside the case there are a couple of areas where you can put a couple of effects pedals, etc.  If you use mini-pedals, you might be able to fit four.  On the outside there is a large, zippered pocket that will fit a small laptop.  Plus, another zippered pocket that has see-thru mesh material.  The zippers are large and heavy duty.  This case is much easier to carry than your typical hard case.  Plus, it looks classy.  I'm glad I bought it.
