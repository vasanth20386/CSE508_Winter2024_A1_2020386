I have been playing for about 25 years on all kinds of gear. My Armand ride and hats never change, The crashes do from time to time. thought I would try a Wuhan crash. it sounds so good. I am so pleasantly surprised. The sound is bright and warm at the same time. the decay is not fast, but not too long either. Even the bell sounds good. I just ordered an 18 Gong crash and a 10 splash. I'll let you know!
