I'm writing several different reviews here on Amazon to inform all of the shoppers that ALL of the low priced scissor arm mic stands on Amazon right now are the exact same model, just branded with the different logo. I actually picked up the "neewer" brand one because it said it came with an integrated XLR cable and a shock mount, but it did NOT, even when I exchanged it for another. Even the box said it has those accessories, but none were included.

So, just so you know, look for the the lowest priced one here and you'll be getting the best deal. I've included a picture of the box even to prove that it's the same Chinese produced product, with different branding. HINT: Tonor isn't the lowest priced one!  ;)
