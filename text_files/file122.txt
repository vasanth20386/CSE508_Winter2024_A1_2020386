My use for a guitar stand is primarily so my guitar actually gets played instead of sitting in it's case.  I love this stand!  It is stable and the pitch on it isn't so great for my Martin DC-15E that it takes up a lot of space.  I like that it doesn't have the higher piece that sits on the neck so it doubles as a decorative piece.  I couldn't be happier!
