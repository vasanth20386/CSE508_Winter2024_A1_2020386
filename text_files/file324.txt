I wanted to wait a few days and give this guitar some time before I reviewed it. I currently own 2 other Dean guitars including a 12 string and I wanted to say that I bought this guitar based upon the reviews here on Amazon which I most often do. I have to admit I really like Dean humbuckers. This guitar did not disappoint.  It is beautiful, and that shiny chrome-like green neck with silver fret bars is awesome.  This guitar is VERY playable--fits well in my hands and has nice low action. I really like the sound it puts out and it DOES stay in tune contrary to the negative comments I read to the contrary.  I really like these tuners because they a precise. It sounds awesome through my Zoom G5 effects pedal. I agree with the reviewer who said 'buy it now'.  You won't  be sorry.  This is now my main squeeze especially for anything rock. I recorded 4 Iron Maiden songs with it.  Sweet!!!!!!!!  I love this guitar. I just love it.  I can't say that enough.
