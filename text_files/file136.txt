Just Hung up one of my Strats. Quickly mounted on the wall above my piano and it seems to be quite secure. I have some heavier guitars and for them I would probably use Toggle bolts instead of the included Screws and mollies but for most of my lighter weight Fenders this is perfect.
I just ordered a second one to go over my bar, I a glad to have found this item.
