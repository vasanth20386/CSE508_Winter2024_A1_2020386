ChromaCast CC-BHC Bass case fits a Squire VI Bass.
While there are only three latches and it might not stand up to the rigors of touring, anyone looking for an inexpensive hardshell case for their Bass VI will be glad to find this gem of a case for about $55 with Prime shipping.  It's not a custom fit, and leaves about an inch of movement lengthwise, but considering the unique sizing of this beast, it's hard to think you'll do better for less than the $200 Fender case.  I took of 1 star for the floppy inner compartment and the lack of reinforcement on the edges.  That said, I'll probably tell every Bass VI owner about this great deal.
