Rock solid, and everything you need to hang your instrument.  Someone's review stated that they were ugly.  Seriously?  I used to buy these for about $25 a piece, and they all look the same.  These get the job done at about 1/3 of the price of most music shops, and if I can trust my Gibson and Martin guitars on them, they are solid.
