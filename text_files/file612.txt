Perfect fit on my Epiphone LP 100.... My beginner guitar.  Had to decide if I wanted to sell my LP-100 after upgrading to an LP Standard.  Decided to keep LP 100 for sentimental reasons but wanted to get rid of Cream colored trim.  Swapped out cream colored pick-up trim and the poker chip for Black ....love it
