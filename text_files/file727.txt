Great little pedal. Wonderful brand. Well built equipment with quality. The housing feels solid and well manufactured. With sound in mind it has a fantastic beautiful depth to it. As a guitarist with roots in rock, grunge and metal it can be a versatile sound with the right mixture. Combined with a marshall tube dc40 and it will not leave you unhappy.
