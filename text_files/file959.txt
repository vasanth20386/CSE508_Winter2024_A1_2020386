This is not a sturdy stand. This is probably not suitable for a school band room. It is a lightweight, foldable and easily stashed stand that barely holds a three ring binder with 50 pages of fake tab. But it does manage to do this. That's all I wanted. I can keep it folded up and out of the way next to the couch and take it out when I need it. Hands down beats the previous music stand I was using: the floor.
