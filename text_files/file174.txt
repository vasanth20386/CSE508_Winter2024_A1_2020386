If you're looking for a gig bag for a semi-hollow guitar or bass, this will do the job. Make sure you are looking for part number 0991622206 - that's the Metro Gig Bag for Semi Hollow basses.

I have a Fender Modern Player Starcaster Bass, which is a short-scale semi-hollow bass. It's both shorter and wider than the typical Fender Precision or Jazz bass and as a result, did not fit any bag or case I already had. I did some research and it turns out that on Fender's website, they specifically state that this gig bag is for semi-hollow basses. I can confirm that my Starcaster fits perfectly, and as an added bonus, my Gretsch G5120 guitar also fits quite nicely.

The padding on the bag is good. I would definitely say it is about average for a gig bag.  The padding about an inch thick and is better than the really cheap gig bags. However, it is not as good as a $150+ Gator gig bag.  I wouldn't check this on a plane, but it would be fine for driving around in your car or just carrying the bass around.
