Love it! I have had other tuners & recently bought a pedal tuner. I like this because it's much more convenient. The pedal wears through 9 volt batteries pretty quick, so I'm constantly plugging & unplugging. W/ this one, I just move it from one headstock to another & turn it on/off as desired...

note: using it for at home/practice/recording...
