For the price, it can't be beat. I hadn't picked up a fiddle in 50 years, so I didn't want to invest a lot of money in something I wouldn't use, but I was pleasantly surprised by this instrument. Of course it's not a high dollar violin, but there is nothing wrong with it.

Edit (after five weeks): I just changed the strings and there is good and bad. First, the bad: the holes for the strings in the tuning pegs had to have been drilled by a nearsighted drunkard. They were all way off-center and most likely weaken the pegs.
Now for the good: I replaced the original strings with D'Addario Pro Arte strings and it made a world of difference. It now sounds just as a violin should and is much more enjoyable to play.
