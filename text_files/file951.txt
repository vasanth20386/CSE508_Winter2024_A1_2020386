I can't see how you could get a better product for the money. This thing is fantastic. The size, man, Donner is really on to something with this Nano design. Around the height of a playing card and half the width. It's tiny but still fully functional for a basic delay/falloff pedal. The tone quality of my Chinese humbuckers through the pedal is great even if I put a distorted signal through it, and the range of adjustment is sure to add some flair to just about any playing style. Build quality is spot on, the plugs are solid, and the quality of the stomp switch would feel right at home on a $100 pedal.

All in all, it's great for the price. If you have 35 bucks burning a hole in your pocket, or you're looking for a cost effective way to get these effects you won't be disappointed.
