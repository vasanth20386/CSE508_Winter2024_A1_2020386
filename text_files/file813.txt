I was invited to play quasi-Dixieland banjo for a quasi-Dixieland musical ("The Boy Friend").  They told me my banjo wasn't loud enough though I thought it was plenty loud. I didn't want to mess with a mike since the sound guys never get that right.  Or with running a DI into the sound board for the same reason.  So I ordered this pickup from Amazon and installed it.  I ran it through a small Crate combo amp (XT65R); it was plenty loud - in fact I'll be cutting it back tonight.  Sound was OK, would probably be better through an "acoustic amp," but it's good enough for the musical.

Won't go 5 stars until I get a chance to try it out in a better setting with better equipment. That said, I am very pleased with the value. I also uploaded two photographs that show the installation.
