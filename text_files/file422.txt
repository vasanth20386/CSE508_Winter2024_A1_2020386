Pretty simple perfect fit a little thicker than the original used it for a vintage modified 70s squire strat to give it an even more classic look. It was very easy to put on just watch a youtube video youll be fine. The black backplate adds a nice touch i have silver and black hardware so that worked out. I felt that the screws they gave me weren't as good as my originals. I did not use them. I think this product is a bit overpriced but thats probably because its laser etched. Adds a nice touch without seeming like you are trying to pass your guitar off for something more expensive. Here are some pictures.
