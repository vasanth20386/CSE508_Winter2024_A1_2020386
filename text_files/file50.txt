My husband got Guitar Hero for Christmas and on a whim added one of these hangers to his wish list.  One of our friends got it for us, almost as a joke-- but then we mounted it and realized how handy it was!  It works wonderfully for our little plastic guitar, saves it from getting scratched up in the closet, and looks pretty darn cool.  Highly recommended!
