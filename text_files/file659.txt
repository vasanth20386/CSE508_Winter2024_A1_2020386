Well... I guess the truth is this product is not for everyone.
Quality does not compare with a regular amp.
You need to purchase apps to be able to get anything out of it.
I guess its for people who are mobile and don't want or cant take their amp with them?
Since I play at home, I wouldn't change using my Fender amp to use this on an ipad or iphone ever.
I am returning the product now, but if you fit the mobile type, you should get it. Best option out there
