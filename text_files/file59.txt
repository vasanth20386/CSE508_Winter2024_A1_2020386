I actually picked up this bass at my local guitar center used, for $60! I brought it home, wiped it down with some dunlop guitar polish, cleaned and treated the fretboard with lemon oil, and put on a D'Addario Light set of strings. I have $75 invested, and it plays amazing! I've played it through numerous cabs, and record with it. Very happy. Check through the used section at GC first if you don't mind a quick cleaning and restring to save you $125!
