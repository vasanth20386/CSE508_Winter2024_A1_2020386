Great pups!

Fender really got these right!
Great vintage tone pups at a steal.
Replaced original Lace pup equipped pickguard in my Strat Plus. And wired up a new pickguard with a .022 cap. Which is working fine for me.

If you also need pickup adjustment screws and you have a modern pick guard. Be aware these come with oval head countersunk pickup adjustment screws for vintage pickguards.
