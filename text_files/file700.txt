Sadly, these strings were suggested as replacements for a Yamaha Guitalele GL-1.
They are not compatible. They are gauged E-e, rather than A-a, and will not fit on the bridge or nut. I am giving it two stars because I can use two of the strings to replace the middle.
Overall, I am disappointed that these would be suggested, but I guess Im the big dummy that wasn't aware and didn't do my due diligence while trusted the recommendation.
If anyone has replaced ALL of the stings on their GL-1, please let me know what you used. Thank you.
