These are decent guitar hangers.  I was worried about hanging an electric due to the weight but it seems to be working just fine.  Obviously lighter acoustics are no problem.

The drywall anchors are a cheap plastic and I broke one while installing.  It still worked well enough to support everything.  In the end, I'm happy.
