At last, a neck cradle that makes sense and has some actual thought put into its design. There's a real popular neck cradle that looks like a rabbit and has a nice leather covering. It's rather expensive and I see
them in lots of shops. The problem is that they're  too short for a lot of guitars, especially acoustics. The rocker neck rest from StewMac is ok, but it's completely useless if you need to flip a guitar over on it's face AND it'll fall over every time you don't need it to. This cradle is perfect in every way. Lots of options for height/angle and the ability to leave the guitar strung and temporarily lock them out of the way onto the lips on this cradle is very, very handy.
