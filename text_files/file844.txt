I've got a five person band for our Hawaiian performing arts group. These headsets make for even audio. No fading in and out as a singer moves closer or farther away from the mic, or turns her face to the right or left. They use the Shure SM58 pick-ups which are time proven. These headsets are especially good when I want to record a live performance. Anyone want to buy my stick mics and stands?
