It's bigger than I expected and when you pull it out of the box it comes in it has this square shape. LOL. I like it and will hold on to the box just for that. Fits perfectly easy on off. The black area is rubber. I thought it would be foam. Pretty good at wind protection. No popping. It looks good with the H4N Pro. A few loose hairs and sheds a little bit but hopefully all the loose ones with be gone after a little while.
