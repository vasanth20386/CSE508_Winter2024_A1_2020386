I do like these strings! Are they the best? There are so many personal preferences. Have you ever asked a drummer what double bass drum pedal they like? It is all too subjective, but I can tell you I have so far liked the quality and feel of the Super Slinky Pink!
It can never hurt to try a few and see what works best for you!

05/25/2017-Still playing this same set of strings on the LP, and they still sound great!

After a couple of hours of playing one of my acoustics, I am ready for a break. The Super Slinky's feel so soft and comfortable. I could play them all day!

I am getting ready to through on a set on the new Tele!
