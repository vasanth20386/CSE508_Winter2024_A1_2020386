Works great! I was happy with the length of the cables and how sturdy the jacks are. This is a great value, with good quality.
Just make sure that your power supply is strong enough to run these, as long as it is you are set! I'm running the following:

Zoom 505 - Modtone  Tremor - Behringer Vintage Phaser - Dunlop Crybaby
