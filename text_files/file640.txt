They came tarnished and discolored, I assume because they were clipped in during storage and shipping, see the pictures. They work with Schallers so you don't have to worry about compatibility and I guess they'll be covered up when I'm playing out, so it's not really that big of a deal but I'm still kind of disappointed. They're also quite a bit bigger but I'm not sure if I hate this, obviously I'm used to smaller Schallers however the larger washer means a more secure connection with my strap and more gold flair. I dunno, I'm still too disappointed with the discoloration.
