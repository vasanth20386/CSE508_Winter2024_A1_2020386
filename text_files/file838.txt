This is very light yet very durable and protective. I have a Squier Strat and it fits perfectly. It won't fit the guitar with the strap on, but I never do that anyways. The pockets are big as well as the inside compartments. Enough room for a few pedels inside or a strap, cord, picks and other small accessories.

Very happy 

FYI, the guitar strap is a Walker & Williams. It was bought on here. Highly recommend that too.
