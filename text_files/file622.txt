Worked ok in a pinch as a last minute purchase.  All of my amp rack patch panels have Neutrik NL4MP connectors, as most of my speakers.  I have some monitors with 1/4" inputs which I am swapping out with Neutrik NL4MPs.  So no more 1/4"inputs and no more knock offs for me.  No I will NOT purchase this product again.
