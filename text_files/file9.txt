I bought this stand for church because I been blessed with a soprano and a alto sax and its realy good and reliable and fit in the front poutch of my sax case with no problems (my alto case has a exstra poutch in the front) but one little thing is that the peg can fit a soprano but its just a little lose but it still is safe for soprano sax.
