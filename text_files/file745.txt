Go up 1 size. My hands are not large for my size and they are certainly not thick. I wear a size medium glove comfortably and large is almost always too big. Yet a size medium in these barely squeezes onto my pinky. Sizing is not close to accurate. Even used a heat gun to expand the opening slightly, no go. Just makes them wider bUT thinner. Disappointed
