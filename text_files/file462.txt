Its a bit taller than I needed, in the neck area, but its not an issue once you fill the pockets. I put my music stand in the pocket by the neck.
I took off one star because the bigger pockets aren't quite big enough to hold my fast track instruction books, which aren't much bigger than the book currently in the pocket, but I just put them behind my guitar.
