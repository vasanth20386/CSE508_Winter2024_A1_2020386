Can't really complain too much for the price. Had a little spot where the paint had flaked off with some rust underneath, and a couple of the 1/4" jacks are a little loose in the center (when I tried to tighten the nut, the whole center part of the jack rotated), but overall they're decent. Got all the terminals soldered together and mounted the crossover right to the plate, and everything seems to work just fine.
