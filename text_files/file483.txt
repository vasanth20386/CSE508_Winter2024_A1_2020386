Prior reviews describing concerns about the handle on this case are accurate.  I bought this case new from GC less than a year ago, have never had it out of my studio, and the handle molding over ball joint is crumbling and falling apart (see photo).  This is not due to abuse, climate or bad design ... it's junk plastic.  Too bad - the fit and finish of this case is perfect for my Gibson Les Paul R8 VOS. I love the design and light weight, but there's no way I'd risk carrying my guitar in it now.  The handle is going to fail at any moment.

UPDATE 19 Feb 2015: I contacted SKB through their website about the handle issue.  They promptly shipped me a replacement handle, with new mounts and instructions. Hopefully the materials problem has been resolved in this replacement part. I really appreciate the follow-through from SKB and added a star to this review for that.
