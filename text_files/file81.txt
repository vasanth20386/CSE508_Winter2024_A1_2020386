This strap is well made and is very comfortable. I installed Dunlop Straploks, which was a chore because the leather is so thick, but I got them on without cutting or modifying the strap. The leather is soft and the padding is nice. I bought another brand of leather strap that claimed it was padded but it wasn't. This strap is nice and cushiony. Highly recommended!
