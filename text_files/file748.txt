Most reviews I've seen recommend new strings and a different bow, neither of which I had. The bridge was already set in place. So, on Christmas morning, she popped in a 9v battery, tuned it up with the existing strings, rosined up the bow that came with it and plugged it into a small amplifier, which resulted in the attached video.

We were pleasantly surprised to say the least. New helicore strings and the bow from her existing acoustic violin would probably make it sound even better. It's currently the #1 best seller on Amazon for good reason and a great value too.
