I'm using this brilliant connector from my iPad retina (running a sequencing app) to a Roland MC-303. Works perfect. Having this connector opens up a whole world of new tech and old tech compatibilities. I'm sure it works great for using USB controllers for Midi as well, since that's really what it was designed for. If you are looking to incorporate your iPad into Midi world, get this now.
