When I first pulled this out of the box I was pleasantly surprised. There were quite a few negative reviews, so I was half expecting  it to arrive in pieces. But it was packaged well and already assembled, so I was pretty happy. Once I had it installed on my rack, I noticed the cable holes in the back aren't even punched out! The main reason I bought this was to store my noisy external hard drive.  I can't do that now, so I guess this drawer is just going to hold random crap that I have on my desk.  I'm honestly pretty bummed. I was tempted to give this two stars, but the drawer itself is pretty acceptable for the price. If you don't need to run cables through the back of it,  then I don't see any reason this wouldn't work for you.
