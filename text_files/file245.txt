All I have to do is install this on my Strat. Instructions gave me a good idea of what needs to be done, and I have experience with all kinds of stuff since I was involved with all types of Proto-Typing in many different machine shops so it should be a fun project.

EDIT: Installed the Fender LSR Roller Nut. I didn't time myself but couldn't have taken more than 1 hour. Playing this guitar is much better now even though the E and e strings are close to the edge of the fretboard. I have less problem placing my fingers cause the strings seem to have a wider spread, I didn't measure this, it's all feel. Absolutely made a positive difference, stays in tune much better than before and the tremolo is adjusted to the floating position.
