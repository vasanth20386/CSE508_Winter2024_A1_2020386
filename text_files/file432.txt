For the price, this is awesome. The heel is larger than a standard Fender neck. If you're building the body, just make a template off the neck itself. The nut is cheap plastic. Buzz at high E 5th fret was fixed just by tapping lightly on the fret with a small hammer. Fret ends are sharp but not dangerous. Not too fat, nor thin. Truss rod turned free and easy.
Will be getting the rosewood finger board next.
