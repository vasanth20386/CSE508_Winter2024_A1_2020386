I've been using this with my new Zoom H1n since I got it, and often times in very windy settings (the beach in particular). This works marvelously, as expected. The fit is perfect and the elastic has just the right about of grab. Other than it being quite large on my little recorder (my kids refer to it as my "chinchilla"), it works like a champ at muffling wind noise.
