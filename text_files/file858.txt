As I said elsewhere, the pick wears on the edges, and breaks very quickly, within hours if you play hard. I use it on an acoustic guitar with Medium to Light strings, so really! After at least 3 years, I am still using my Dunlop medium guitar pick. The rubber part also "hangs" on the low E string, especially if you are trying to hit it for the first beat of the measure or simply for emphasis. This is probably a bad habit, which I could unlearn, but only if the pick would last longer!
Why not sell replacement picks (as mentioned by another reviewer: for a quarter), to snap into the rubber holder? Then you could also offer light, medium and hard replacement picks.
