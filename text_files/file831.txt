This thing is FANTABULOUS! A great product! For the price and quality and performance. I use it on my upright bass. It gives me the volume and tone I want. Playing it through my Peavey TNT 100 bass amp I place it on the lower belly under the strings with the jack on the side secured by Velcro. I use industrial strength Velcro. I may place it lower with the wire hidden beneath. It gives me the top end and the bottom. I highly recommend it. Although it is durable, I'm going to buy two more. Just because it is the best adaptor for the quality and for the money.
