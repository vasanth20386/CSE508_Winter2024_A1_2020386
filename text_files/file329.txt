The design of this tool is great overall. I like the flexibility of it, and it does its job well. You are going to hear less sibilance from the vocals that are being recorded. I definitely will recommend this to every artist and/or mixing engineer to get a clean, quality recording. Its cheap, so the price will not be a big problem for you. You see a pop filter in most studios these days, and don't worry about yours not being the most expensive or the most advanced. Most of the time, you can get the same job done with the equipment you have. So keep it up. This project won't let you down.
