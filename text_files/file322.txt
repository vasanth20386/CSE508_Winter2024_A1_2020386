I saved my money for retirement, so I could afford a quality musical instrument. I did all my online research, and tested many guitars at music shops. Some felt like works of art, flashy, shiny, with that dipped in plastic look and feel. The Jim Dandy looked old style with jumbo fret markers, and a satin type finish...I thought it was old! I strummed a few chords and it played ok. I liked the short size and bought a back pack style case. I ride my bike two miles with my guitar every day to jam with friends at the Marina. This Gretsch Jim Dandy kicks mine and everyone that hears or plays it's butt! It stays in tune and the sound it puts out, tho not too loud, is pure nostalgia at it's finest! She cries the blues, yet if you finger pick a happy tune, you can't stop from smiling. This may not be an expensive instrument, but it's a true classic.
