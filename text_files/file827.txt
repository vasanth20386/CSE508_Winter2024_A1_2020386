Purchased the 5-hole pickguard in eggshell for my MIM Baja Telecaster. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much since I hated the cheap, white plastic version that came stock. Black Bakelite looked good, gold anodized aluminum looked better, but somehow this one just seems right. It's a heavy, vintage thickness, rigid, and very high quality. The eggshell color adds just enough warmth as well. There is no shielding so you may want to slap some copper foil on the back.

Note that this is NOT for Squiers that are made in Japan. Should fit all USA and most MIM models.
