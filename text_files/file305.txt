This pedalboard is the best value entry level board ive seen on amazon.... Very well made, sits on floor with a good angle, very useful slats and spacing to make cables tidy underneath so you can organise the pedals in a non linear fashion  .  Its big enough to grow into. Love the lightweight aluminum. Velcro straps come with it to strap on your mini power supply (donner psu no less lol).  I also hid my noise suppressor underneath since thats an always-on pedal.  This way, you get even more pedal space on top. I fit all my pedals and probably room for one or two mini pedals or one more regular sized pedal.

Two complaints:

Wouldve been kind for donner to throw in long strips of velcro too but nope.... No included velcro.

Carrying case is cheap with almost no real padding. Couldve given a tad more padding here.
