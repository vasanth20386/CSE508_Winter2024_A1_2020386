I have a 1950s Fender tweed amp, so I wanted to get this strap to match it. It is a perfect match! The leather on the ends is a bit lighter than in the product picture, but it's fine. I love that the stripe is Fender tweed, which any musician should recognize. It's not garish -- it's a subtle statement. The feel of the fabric is nice, and it isn't too stiff like some straps are. All in all, it was a good purchase.
