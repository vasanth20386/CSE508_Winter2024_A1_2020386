I purchased two of these to hang guitars in my music room. These are well made and certainly do the job okay. However, I completely did NOT trust the two skimpy screws they provided to hang this unit. They are basically drywall screws, but these have a rather skinny diameter. I was not about to trust my vintage P-Bass to a skinny screw inside a hollow-wall fastener. No, I used a heavier "construction screw" directly into a wall stud. See photo. I was seriously concerned that the supplied skinny screw would actually break off in the stud. If you are hanging a lightweight acoustic, then the supplied hardware should be fine. I'm probably just being paranoid and overly cautious.  Other than that, I like it (tho walnut piece could be a little bigger in my opinion).
