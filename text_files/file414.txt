Works as advertised (I'm sure along with the other 5 or 6 brands out there that are the exact same one- see pic it's the one they shipped). Only thing I'd say is pay attention to your current- everything worked fine except my wireless (line 6). It'd power up but then go dark. Turns out it was plugged into a 100ma port. It needs upwards of 300+ma. Plugged into the correct port and it was fine. So far no issues after about 6 or 7 gigs. I'm surprised because it's priced so cheap. Comes with all the barrel (power) cords (Not the 1/4" cords). Can't go wrong for under $40.
