I bought a pair of these just over a year ago, at first they worked just fine then I started getting static when adjusting the Volume control to the point where the Main speaker was not playing but the other one was. Having bought then outside of the US it was very difficult to get the warranty honored so I decided to fix them myself as I am a technician. What I discovered was the volume controller which is also the Power switch was defective, and I could not get a replacement. so what I did was replace the volume control with another one and and added a power switch. Now it works like a charm.
