Bought as a strap for my Cordoba mini. Very lightweight and convenient, the length is enough.

The only thing that I plan to replace is screw that holds loop for tie. I want something that can be released quickly and doesn't require fastening.

Both pictures show strap at it's full length (I'm 6'2")
