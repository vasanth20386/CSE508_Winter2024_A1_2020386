I bought 4 to use for my pedal board that I just made. Upon opening the first one, it was not one continuous piece. It was cut towards one end and as I unrolled it, a shower of the black mushroom nubs came falling out (see picture). Hmm...maybe just a bad roll. I opened the second one. This one was one continuous piece, and only a few nubs fell out. Ok, lets test it out. I attached it to itself and pressed it together. Nice grip. Then I pulled it apart, and several bunches of nubs came tearing out as well. If I'm going to attach something to my pedal board that will bond permanently, I don't want  something that will tear itself apart and leave bald patches every time I move a pedal. I'm sure it would work fine, if you don't move things around, but just the idea that I can't do it do often doesn't sit well. Oh well, expensive lesson learned. Get the 3M instead. I have used it in the past. Good stuff.
