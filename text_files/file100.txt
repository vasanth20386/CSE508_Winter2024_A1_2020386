This amp is the real deal.  Great crunch and gain tones and with some tweaking, not half bad clean"ish" tones.  I've played this through the two 8" Orange cabs (had to get those too as they were just TOO cool ((and cute)) and not crazy money) and the sound is very pleasing and revealing for a practice amp.  I primarily play it through my Blackstar stack that I've fitted with Celestion V30s... Wow...there it is~!!!  You would never know this thing was such a tone monster... Even with just a few knobs it's easy to get lost for hours playing this thing.  My favorite match is with my Chapman ML-1 Hotrod...which only has a volume "tone" control (EVH fans get this).  Not a lot of mucking around with too many knobs or too many options on either the guitar or this amp... Just tone up and go.  I see the Micro Dark just came out...that's probably next~!  Higher gain, buffered effects loop and speaker emu at the headphone out for recording direct (if that's your thing).
