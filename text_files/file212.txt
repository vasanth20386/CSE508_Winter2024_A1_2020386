You shouldn't have to buy RPS to get strings you can bend.... I have been using Ernie Ball Super Slinkies since the 1980s. I love the feel and sound they produce. but I'm done. I have seen too many .09, .10 .11 and .13 strings slip and let go lately. Could it be that it is impossible or too expensive to make them with quality US-made steel?
The pictured string constantly dropped in pitch, making it unusable for playing in public and frustrating for practice.
C'mon Ernie Ball, make usable strings and I will return.
Any suggestions for other strings that feel and sound like Slinkies or Super Slinkies?
Edited for spelling, lol...
