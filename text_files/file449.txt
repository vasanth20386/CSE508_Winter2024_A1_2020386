This foam windscreens are a little bit smaller than I had hoped. They will fit most microphones, but unfortunately my Blue Yeti is too large to comfortably fit these covers on. Even after stretching the foam and muscling it on, the foam still leaves a bit of the microphone's mesh uncovered. I'll attach some photos of how these windscreens fit different types of microphones.
