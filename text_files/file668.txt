this pedal is for marshall amps it with a e.q. and compressor made a awsome metal skull ripping tone I was thinking of a voodo mod but a friend told me about the pedal and man its got more than enough gain  i mean lots of distortion it and eq compressor makes for a great combo  so get rid of all the tube screamers and go to the turbo rat if you got a marshall
