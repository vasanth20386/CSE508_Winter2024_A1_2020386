Perfect fit on my 2016 Gibson Les Paul Studio Faded.  I didn't like the original speed knobs because they were too big and clunky-feeling. I was skeptical about these knobs after reading some reviews about poor quality, but I think they're very high quality.  The finish is perfect on them:  No seams, scratches, chips, etc.  I don't know what more someone could expect quality-wise.

They also sit much closer to the body than the old speed knobs, so it's a cleaner look.

I truly can't imagine why anyone would have any problem with these whatsoever if they're ordering for a USA-made Gibson.  I don't think these will fit so well on an Epiphone though.
