These are amazing! Not just for the price, they are just really great pickups. I rapped mine with friction tape over copper foil tape to fight against cheap wiring in my home.

They fit perfectly in a project guitar and because they sound so lush I will be making this guitar my #1 rhythm in my home studio.
