I like these microphpone windscreens and the price can't be beat. I have a few lavalier microphones and wanted to use them for recording outdoors. Unfortunately they are larger than what I would consider a lav mic windscreen. I have found they work best with my olympus me51s lav mic and they significantly reduced wind/ambient noise outside. The colors are nice and help in location them and not misplacing them. I have lost so many small black lav wind screens that if I had a dime...well you know the rest. I included a picture in the customer gallery so you can see beyond the stock photo what you're buying. I would recommend and just mention again, be aware of the size you're getting.
