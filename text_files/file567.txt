The normal adapters to be able to mount an Apogee MiC onto a regular microphone stand are about $20 for a made-for-the-purpose one or about $10 for a camera adapter which can be made to work (kind of ugly looking though, in my opinion).  What I did was to buy this adapter for less than $2 and then I ground off flush the screw stem on it.  I then used a small 1/8" drill bit to drill a hole large enough to allow the Apogee's OEM tripod's screw to be able to attach this adapter to the swivel adapter part of the factory Apogee tripod.  Sounds complicated but it was super easy to do, works great and saved some money.
