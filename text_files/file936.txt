I use CS Robert Cray set in one guitar...THAT tone. These '59 set are equal in tone heaven. Tried 57/62 set...not enough subtle chime and throaty sound, too much hammer thud. I've owned a '63 vintage Stratocaster , back in the early 70's when they were $250-$300...THESE pickups give me
what I got spoiled on. Forget Fat 50's~Texas specials, unless you enjoy mud coming out of your speakers. I like hearing guitar, not a floor full of pedals that produce kazoo sounds in the end......I'm 66...I know tone when I hear it...with these ...I hear it..
GO BUY THEM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
