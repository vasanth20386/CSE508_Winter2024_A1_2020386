Excellent, clear, punchy, great note definition. 60s rock, 70s R&B, modern jazz, this set covers it all. I build custom guitars and basses, have tried many different types and brands. These are my go to pickups. To be honest, I was a bit surprised at how articulate these are, as the SD quarter pound p-bass pickups are somewhat dark.
