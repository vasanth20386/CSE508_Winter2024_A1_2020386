I now have eight of these.  I enjoy seeing my instruments, and feel confident they are safely off the floor away from little monsters.  I didn't understand they came in different woods so they don't all match.  No matter, they still work well.  I wasn't real sure about the mounting screws that came with them.  However, they have been up a couple of years and no problem at all.  Note, I am not hanging mandolins which are a bit heavier.  I have tenor and soprano ukuleles.  Second note: the cushioned part that holds the instrument comes in different sizes, the narrow size is the one you need for thru tuners.
