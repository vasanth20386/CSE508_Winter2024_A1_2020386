great little stand , good price and fast prime shipping make this a good deal and value...i got it paired along with a ChromaCast small bench stool also folding...only down side was that the stand was missing one of the rubber end caps for the top crosspiece, so my keyboard is a little tippy and unstable....i'm trying to figure out how to get only the missing end cap piece and not have to return the whole stand,and wait for a replacement.
