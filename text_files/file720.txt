Good product, though in the 15 I bought there were slight inconsistencies in the angle lock mechanism. It seems the button latch is a little too low to click into place consistently on some of them, but it doesn't affect them in any real way unless you're the type who uses a protractor to angle your instruments just so. Also, if you have smaller headstocks on your guitars or basses, you'll probably need to adjust the width of the holder with channel-locks or something similar that can squeeze the sides together. Still, they look good, even better when mounted on a piece of stained pine, and they hold my guitars and basses nicely.
