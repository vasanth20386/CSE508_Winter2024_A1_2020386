I gave a cheaper neck a shot. I am blown away by the look of this neck. The stain used is just enough to highlight the grain nicely and the clear coat is darn near perfect. I figured a lot of time would be during the "adjustment" phase of the build. Nothing else had to be done once the neck was set and bolted on. What a pleasant surprise since in past builds I'd spent an hour or more getting them set. I've used Fender and Warmoth before that cost 3 times and more than this one. The proof had been in the pudding though. This neck has been on this guitar for over a year now. No problems. I use this guitar as a back up and play it quite frequently on gigs. I buy more!
