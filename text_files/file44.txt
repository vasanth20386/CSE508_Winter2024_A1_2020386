Awesome stand. Best one I've ever had. It's not that heavy easy to carry in maneuver. The push adjustment for the up-and-down is great quick and easy holds really good.

I did put a counterweight cuz my tube recording mic is kind of heavy.. wish I could buy 20 for 50 bucks. Wish they had a deal for multiple...
