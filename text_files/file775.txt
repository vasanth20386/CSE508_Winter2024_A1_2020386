I used to own a Boss CS-3. This pedal is almost as good for less than 1/2 the price and footprint.

It's built very well for the price. I got silly and replaced the black knob with a clear acrylic one to make it look cooler.

I have the Donner morpher as well. This stuff is seriously good for the price. Mooer is the only other contender in this price and size range. I run this into a Mooer Tender Octaver and wow. Wowwwy wow wow
