I was really looking forward to using this keyboard due to it having all of the features that I needed at it's particular price point. When I opened it up, it didn't even come in it's own box. It's box was just the shipping box. Immediately after taking it out of the box, I heard this rattle as if something was loose inside and it fell through the entire keyboard  like a rain stick. I checked out all of the keys individually and they all worked except for a C# on the lowest octave.

I don't know if it was the fault of Nektar,  AudioDeluxe or UPS but I just can't really recommend this keyboard the way I had received it.
