At first, this would not work with the AT2020 USB+  microphone.  The pole is too thick to screw into the mount that comes with the mic.

Then I discovered that there is a silver removable nut inside the stand that comes with the mic. Once that was unscrewed and removed, this stand fit perfectly.

Stand itself, nice and sturdy. Makes the mic stand a bit taller than the stock tripod stand, which is just terrible.
