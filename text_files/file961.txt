I bought this last week from another retailer. This is the best case I have ever purchased, but it's heavy as hell! I wasn't expecting it to be 150lbs empty.

The table is extremely sturdy. Folds out easy. The table can be reversed to either side. Casters are solid as a rock, so solid if you get this thing past 5mph and hit a rock, this thing may flip. Try not to keep it top heavy. Only con I can think is, it's a pain to flip back up if you lay it down. I laid it down to install equipment,I couldn't pick it back up no matter what I tried. You're gonna love this thing
