This pair of Samson GT Studio Monitors was a great start for me, they aren't your loudest speakers, but they still pack a punch. They can still be mixed on, and give a good all around frequency response. What you want to be careful of is the bass, and mixing bass on these because they will not provide all of the bass that is really there. They are great for mids. The portability is amazing! Along with the fact that you will NOT need an audio interface with these! The Mic plugs directly into the speaker! What a easy and accessible way for an artist to record his vocals, or for a guitarist to to record his notes. Definitely a good investment!
