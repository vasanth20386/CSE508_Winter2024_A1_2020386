This pedal have been a good addition to my pedal board.  It did take some time to dial in the right mix and level.  I personally do not use the chorus and vibrato, but it does add a cool later to the sound.  The delay is very good and natural sounding.  This pedal is a great alternative to similar pedals that are much more expensive.

The pedal is in a solid metal housing.  The knobs are sturdy and have a good feel.  Overall a great pedal for the price.
