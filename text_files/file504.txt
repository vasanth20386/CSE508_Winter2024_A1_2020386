This tailpiece is very solid and the plating and finish couldn't be better. So great for the price. I don't expect plating will stand contact/rubbing for long, but that's the case with most gold plated hardware, so I suggest any gold hardware be handled delicately. I know gold plating costs so much more than its price, so it's a bargain.
