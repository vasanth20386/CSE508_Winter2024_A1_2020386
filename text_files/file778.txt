Impressive brightness, 30 beam angle, and fixture is well-built. Saving static colors was tricky at first, but the vendor was more than helpful with tech support. Once your color is set manually, if you press setup again after setting the color you wanted, you will have the same color next time you power it back up. Overall, impressed considering the cost and brightness. Flawless DMX control!
