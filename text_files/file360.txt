Bought this for the brass tip, didn't need the rest. Just wanted to beef up my Zakk Wylde Les Paul Custom Plus to make all the gold hardware match. Does the job perfectly!! But be warned: the added weight of the metal gives the switch a much heavier and thicker clicking sound when switching from pup positions. It doesnt bother me because I play metal and this sound doesnt come through the amp. But for you clean players, this heavy clunk might be audible through your amp. However, I would still give it a shot and see if you like it and can even hear it because it looks great and everyone hears their music differently! And I actually like the added chunky feel. Makes my Grail feel just a bit more tough!
