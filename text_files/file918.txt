The last drummer who played the USA Ludwig kit I my studio used a set of the black paint Vic Firth Steve Gadd signature stick and left black paint marks all over my white coated drum heads as black paint flecks all over. Luckily I already knew that a tiny bit Magic Eraser removes things like that from those drum heads.

As you can see from pictures the drummer has pretty good technique as there are no cracks on the sticks. If the stick didn't have paint on them I would give them five stars as every type of Vic Firth stick I've used has been excellent.
