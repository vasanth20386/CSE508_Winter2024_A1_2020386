This is a nice stand, but it doesn't work great for my concert-sized ukulele.  It's definitely durable and adjustable, but it's a little too large for my instrument.  I have tried to pull the legs of the stand closer together in order to better accommodate the size of my ukulele, but in doing that, it feels a bit unstable.  If you're looking for a compact, inexpensive stand, I would definitely recommend this one, but just be aware that it might not work as well for smaller instruments.
