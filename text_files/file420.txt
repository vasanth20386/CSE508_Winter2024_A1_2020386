I have a 1986 Peavey Patriot made in the usa guitar. It had one cheap string tree that wasn't a roller. These work great! Make sure to drill the holes for any of these trees you are going to install. The included screw cannot handle the pressure of screwing it in. I will add pictures soon. You won't be disappointed. They add incredible sustain to my guitar!
