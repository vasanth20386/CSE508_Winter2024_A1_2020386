I bought this bass to split time as my primary bass with my Dean Edge. This might be winning me over. The bass boost is outstanding. The active pickups really allow you to adjust to the sound you want. I recommend this for anyone. If you're a beginner  like I was not too long ago, it's an excellent bass to start with. If you're on tour and/or music is making you money, this bass will be beatiful on stage. The color is a bit darker than in the picture. But, all around, this is a great buy.
