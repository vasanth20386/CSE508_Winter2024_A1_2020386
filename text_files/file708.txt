First of all these lights look great! The flashing patterns and bright lights really add pazaz to a party or get together as long as the lights are dimmed of course. The LX-5 has a built-in microphone which is used to match up the light flashes to the beat of a song playing, and this works very well as long as your speakers have a subwoofer (built in or external). I listened to some dubstep tracks while using this and I couldn't believe how accurate it was! The lights alternated between each color during the climb, and flashed in a unison strobe at the drop!

So why is this getting a 3 star review? After a week of use, three out of the four strips of blue circle lights just stopped working. Everything else works just fine after months of use, but most of the blue lights are missing. I would have returned it if the vendor I bought it for didn't charge $10 shipping and $15 restocking. However most people here don't seem to have this problem, so I would say it's worth the risk of purchase. Just check who you're buying it from!
