Gamechanger mixer. One of the few things that has been made in this century that is decent. I use it in a studio rack that replaced a Mackie 1202VLZ, a Yamaha REV500 DSP and a Behringer 31 band DEQ2496. Was a little reluctant to replace all these devices, but over time I gave in as I learned/experimented more with this mixer. I control it with an IPAD Air 2- prefer it over Android as I can place the RTA, the EQ and the channel strip all on the same screen without having to toggle. My only small gripe is that updates and development of the IOS XAir app have not been much of a priority (2 years between 1.42 and 1.5?) . It can be a little overwhelming- after 6 months, I'm still learning more about it and that's a good thing- they'res stuff I can do with this mixer that I could not do with any analogue mixer I've had/used. Love the idea that I can take the IPAD and roam.
