When I bought my Roland Gaia, I needed another stand, as I already have two keyboards on a double tiered stand, and I think 3 is too much.  The least expensive stand available at "that other store" was over $30, so I figured I get something used, or local.  Checking Amazon, I saw this stand, which at the time of my order was $20.00 even.  It seemed like a great value, so I ordered it.  The packaging was a little flimsy, but the stand arrived in one piece and in good condition.  It fit my Gaia perfectly.  The included straps don't work with the Gaia, but the stand holds the keyboard well, and at the right height.  It's a little beefier than stands in that price range, though not as beefy as my 2 tier stand, though that was much more expensive.  This is totally a five star stand at the price I paid, and even at $5.00 more at the time of this review.  For an inexpensive stand, I don't think anyone can do better.  Recommended.
