I loved this guitar stand at first b/c it held my Guild & Martin acoustics securely. After about a year of stationary use, the plastic housing which was responsible for holding up the neck support cracked and cannot be repaired (see pics). Since I'm past any warranty period, I'm stuck.

Additionally, all of the rubber developed a gummy residue which was sticky to the touch. I often had to go try to wash it off after touching it, even accidentally. I had a Hercules mic stand which developed a similar problem before it also broke.

Gave it a 2-star review because I got a year of use out of it, but I probably won't buy another Hercules product.
