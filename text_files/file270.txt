Do not let the low price fool you! This is an incredible device with the free mixing software. It has been years since i tracked anything. Back then everything was Solid State and Analogue. With this Scarlett Solo, a moderate computer, and a large monitor (i stress large because there is too much control with the software), you can really lay down some serious tracks.

So if you are new or getting back to it, GET IT!
