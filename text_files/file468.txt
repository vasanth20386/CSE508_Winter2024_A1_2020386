Stunned at how clear and full the audio was.  Very easy to use with my iPhone and a free audio recording app (Voice Record).  Then just push the result up to Dropbox.
I used it while giving a talk to a large family group using a PPT show. Later combined the youMic recording with the PowerPoint and only had to edit a few words here and there for content.  No EQ or Compression even necessary!
Wish I had tried this a long time ago.
