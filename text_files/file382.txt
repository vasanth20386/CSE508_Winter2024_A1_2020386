After much online shopping, and 20 years of using traditional stands, I needed something with easier access and greater stability than the standard 3 leg stands. I had six guitars in stands, and this Hercules unit had the best reviews. The box arrived in great shape, and I pulled out the stand and popped it open and it was ready to go. Included was additional parts to add a 6th guitar to the stand, which I needed. Very easy to configure the spacing, and load the guitars, stable. Now it is easy for me to grab a guitar to play and then put away. I have an acoustic, 3 electrics, a semi-hollow body electric (E335 style), and a bass. Highly recommended.
