This is a basic pedal for vocal enhancements, but it lacks in the department of effects and customization. It would have been nice to have more effects and greater control over their parameters.
It sucks that the tone feature is only usable in 440hz tuning. Also the manual recommends placing it to the front of your effects chain, but If you've got pedals which don't play well with others like my Blackout Effectors Fuzz Bear, you should put it after those, as it tends to overdrive your output signal. With this having the functionality of a stompbox you'd want to mount it within your first line of pedals on your board for ease of switching, but the amount of cables running at the back takes up needed space if your pedal board is small . But for vocal basics it's a good starting point.
