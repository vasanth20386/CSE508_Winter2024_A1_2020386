I upgraded the bass and tom tom heads on my Pearl Rhythm Traveler kit (ASIN: B0002FO4R8) to these heads with amazing results. Before upgrading the open bottom toms had a lot of ring and were impossible to get the tone I wanted no matter how carefully I tuned them. I replaced the heads with these and was rewarded with an amazing difference in sound quality. The ringing, hollow quality I previously struggled to correct is now a nice "thump" sound that works perfectly with jazz and rock.

In addition to this head I upgraded to the 10" (ASIN: B0002E1FQW) on my other mounted tom and the 14" (ASIN: B0002D0DSO) on my floor tom.  The results were so dramatic that I also upgraded the batter side head on my bass drum with the 20" bass drum head (ASIN: B0002D0E3S).

In addition to achieving the exact sound I wanted I also get far better stick response, and have found that tuning these heads are far easier than any other head I've used, including Remo that I use on my Ludwig kit.

These heads have transformed a relatively inexpensive drum kit into a professional quality kit that is incomparable in sound and performance.
