These strings are wonderful. My go to strings have been the Gibson Bill Monroe, however amazon does not stock those currently. So I decided to give these a try because they are the same gauge and phosphorus bronze just like the Gibson. These sound just as good if not better than the Gibson BM strings. They are warm, bright and very projecting. They have that signature bluegrass sound that you hear on the classics. I love these strings!
