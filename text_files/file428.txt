This strap is advertised for a mandolin, but I put it on my ukulele. I found guitar straps (usually 2 inches wide) and even dedicated ukulele straps (usually 1.5 inches wide) to be too bulky and uncomfortable. This strap is only 3/8" inch wide, but my ukulele is so lightweight that I really don't need anything wider and a narrower strap doesn't get in the way of my arms and hands. Installing this strap without removing my ukulele strings took some effort. I had to unthread the strap loop (which is really much tighter than it needs to be), then thread the strap end under my ukulele strings, then thread it back through the strap loop (which is still much tighter than it needs to be). The plastic buckle in the middle of the strap is not removable, so you need to thread that through strap loop and it is a real tight fit. Once installed, the strap works great. The thin soft-ish cotton is more comfortable on my shoulder than thick leather or stiff nylon strap and it doesn't seem to scratch my ukulele wood at all.
