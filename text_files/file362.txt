Great controller. The sound and build quality are very good. Balanced outputs, aux, 4 channels of control, huge responsive jog wheels. This controller also has VU meters for every single channel which is really hard to find at this price point. The low and high pass filters have a nice whisp to them. The only thing I don't like are the feel of the performance pads. They are not pads but more like triggers. Don't get me wrong, they work fine and are responsive but they do not feel like the pads that are on the pioneer ddj for example. They are not velocity pads. Other than that this thing is a beast and well worth the money.
