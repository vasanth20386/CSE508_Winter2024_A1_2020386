Competitors had detailed drawings and better pictures causing me to worry I'd made a mistake with these. Luckily, when I tried to cancel, I was too late. These dandies hold the pickguard firmly and even better-the correct countersink, satiny color & flatish profile make them nearly disappear into the pickguard. PERFECTION!
