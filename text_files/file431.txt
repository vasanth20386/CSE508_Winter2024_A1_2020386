Nicely made, very secure, very plush on the inside.  And a bit heavy, but it keeps the guitar safe from my klutzy self.

I originally ordered this case for my Luna Safari Muse Nylon guitar; it's a bit roomy for the Luna but a little bit of padding on the bout end of the case makes the Safari more secure.  I bought a Cordoba Cadete 3/4 guitar shortly after ordering the case, and the Cadete fits like the case was made for it - no movement at all in the case.
