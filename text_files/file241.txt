Great pickguard!  Used on my MIM strat project.  Purchased a black MIM body from amazon and this 3ply black with white border pickguard from musiclily.  Guitar looks awesome!  This is a very quality product.  Especially for the price.  My guitar body didn't have pickguard holes, so I had to drill them.  I just taped this pickguard down in place and drilled the holes.  I am really happy with the result!
