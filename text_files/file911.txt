Wow this thing is so cool I play it threw two orange 8" cabs it is my favorite practice amp by far. Three knows zero bull $#!+. Once I turn it up around 2 my dog starts to howl no joke I really goes. I'm going to try jamming with it here soon and see how it contends with my brute of a drummer. It can go from clean to pretty dirty but if you really want to get nasty you will need a nice hot humbucker and a distortion pedal. I dug it's sound I didn't bother with a pedal for the first week. Can't go wrong for the price. The little tube in the preamp does really make it sound good.
