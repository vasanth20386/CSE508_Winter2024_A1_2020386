I purchased this to protect my Jim Dandy guitar when I'm out and about.  It is a parlor sized guitar and needed a fairly snug fit - a regular dread bag was just WAY too big.

The Jim Dandy measures 36  tall x 13  wide x 4  deep, and this bag fit perfect.  Pics included to show how it works.

I paid $25 and it was well worth it.
