I needed a smaller pedalboard for my solo setup and considered building one. When I saw the price on this one I decided to try it. Awesome. I fit a large amp pedal, EQ pedal, loop pedal, loop controller pedal and surge protector on this bad boy with room to spare. Well made and packs up compactly. Before you break out the plywood and Velcro give this pedalboard a go.
