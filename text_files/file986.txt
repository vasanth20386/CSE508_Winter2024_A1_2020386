Bought this case for a 650mm classical guitar. There is some spare room around the body of this guitar. In the picture attached, you can see a box of strings (3/4"), fits in between the guitar and case, but with the lid closed, the guitar doesn't move around, it feels secure.

I would not use this as a flight case. Light transport only, maybe carry-on luggage, if it were allowed.

This is my sixth SKB case, and it won't be the last.
