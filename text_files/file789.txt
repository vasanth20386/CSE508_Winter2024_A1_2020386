There are only a few things I needed to know before I purchased this Alto/Tenor stand.  1.  Did it hold my Tenor and Soprano properly? 2.  Would this particular stand work properly on different surfaces? 3.  Is the design portable and easy for setup for gigs/home use to easily swap for doubled soprano?

Answer is .......... Yes!

This particular stand is very compact, snaps into place and holds my equipment perfectly.  Given that the feet sit flush to the ground, it creates a balance that keeps the instruments from wobbling while on the stand.  I currently use as my pro setup a Yamaha 62-iii tenor, and an allora paris (woodwind and brasswind pro model) soprano.  I am attaching a photo so you can see the setup.  This stand is a great value and allows me to swap instruments with ease and securely without fear of the instruments falling.
