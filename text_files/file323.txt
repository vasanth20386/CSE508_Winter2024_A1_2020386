The direct drive assembles and mounts easily. It works well with the right foot and is responsive. Also, it adjusts easily for travel and mallet through. It provides a distinct bass sound freeing up your two hands on the Cajon. It will provide more of a drum kit sound particularly if your Cajon has string sound.
