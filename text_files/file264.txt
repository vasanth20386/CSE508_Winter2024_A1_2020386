I just tested this fog fluid with a 1byone 400W fogger. Two 30 second bursts were sufficient to create enough fog layers for a moody atmosphere in a 2 car garage. This being a hot space I was pleasantly surprised by how long the fog would linger. It would quickly rise to eye level and then just hang there. Another nice surprise was the odor- there is not much of it, but if you step in the middle of a thick pocket it smells like lavender (?) soap.
Only downside is that the fog is not very dense. The difference between 2 bursts and 5 bursts was not too pronounced; it's a grey mist that does not become white or truly opaque, with visibility remaining at > 9 feet.
