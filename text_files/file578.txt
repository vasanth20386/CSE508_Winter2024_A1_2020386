This box does everything I need it to. It's passive, so it doesn't color the sound, it makes for easy switching between my two sets of monitors, and even has an auxiliary input (RCA connection) with separate volume control (which I use to patch in an xbox. Gotta take 5 from working every once in a while!). The main volume knob is really smooth and has some slight resistance, which makes it feel great when dialing in levels.

I chose to mount it under my desk with the included brackets (mounted upside-down so the box is hanging) so that it's right at arm height for extremely quick access. People have said the headphone amp isn't great, but I've never used it as I connect my headphones directly to my interface when needed, so I can't comment on that claim.

I don't tend to throw money around for the studio all "willy nilly", but I'm sure glad I purchased this unit.
For something that really doesn't do much, it's definitely a unit that make working a lot more enjoyable.
