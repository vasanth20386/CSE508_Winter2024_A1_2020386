We needed to upgrade the Hot Hitz Radio mixer. We needed the AUX sends to properly work a Telos ONE which places listener phone calls on the air. Our old mixer did not have this option so it was time to upgrade. This is a great mixer and the price was really good if you are on a budget. We use this mixer in a studio.
