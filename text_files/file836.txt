I like this pedal very much so far. My favorite pedal was a Joyo and it didn't last long. It's in my junk pile. I hate the for the money thing. This delay pedal does a lot more than most one trick ponys out there. Money when you get into Chinese stuff is a gamble, I hope I get some time out of this Joyo because it just that great.
