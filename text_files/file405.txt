This guitar is far more beautiful in person. The red to gold tones blend so wonderfully and it has a barely visible tiger-stripe/wood pattern effect that I hadn't noticed prior to purchasing it. I got it here for a fraction of the price I was finding it other places. I have had no problems with it whatsoever yet, it plays easily and sounds like I spent a lot more on it than I did. It even arrived sooner than was expected.
