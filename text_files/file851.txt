Oh my word I am sold I love my AT2100 which Ive used for 5+ years for podcasting and YouTube BUT this thing is amazing for my current use case. Im using it as a boom above my head for YouTube videos. Wow! At about 2-3 feet away it is perfect. Very rich sound for my bassy voice. I recommend this to anyone who wants a budget mic with awesome sound.
