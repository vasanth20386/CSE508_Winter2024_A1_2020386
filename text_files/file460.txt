Amazon's product states that this shock mount fits 43 to 50mm diameter mics. It does not. It will not even fit my MXL V69XM which specs out at 47 mm diameter. See the photos ... it does not fit even with a white-knuckle effort to open the jaws. I ordered three through Amazon and none of them came in a Neewer box that was shown. Grossly under-size!
I was able to reach into the inside of the shock and stretch the band open more. Was able to save 2 of 3 shocks. The third one can be seen in the attached photo with an insulator that was cut too short and was rusting inside. This one is going back.
