It was exactly as I expected. Sounds great under all circumstances! Hot sound, without being harsh. Serious attitude. Serious attack. Sounds great clean also. All of this, without losing the guitar's natural voice. Installed it in a '78 Stratocaster, and gave it a new life. It's just too bad that it took me decades to finally take the plunge to switch from a Super D. (which had been my go to in all my guitars since the mid 80s).
