I will be switching ALL of my snare drums to this head. Why?
the sound is PERFECT!
the tuning is PERFECT!
Produces rich VOLUME for brushes that will last for the life of the head.
It is NOT CLEAR! It is NOT WHITE! It is a lovely OPAQUE FROST!
By far, it is the most beautiful head I have ever seen and it is a perfect match for the Ludwig Super Phonic aluminum alloy shell as oppose to ugly old white, white, white, or a big ugly black black dot on white. The silver center dot has a really slick, brushed 21st century metal look to it and...well... IT'S JUST GOT CLASS! It DOES NOT have a cheesy sprayed on "ruff-coat" finish but the surface is ETCHED (like the Evans jazz head) for brush use...VERY easy to clean any of that dark residue you get from wire brushes.

Included a shot next to my 5 1/2 Millennium snare that has a Remo Renaissance head.
I use a 200 or 300 clear on the snare side and Pure Sound snares.
Sorry Remo...Evans just ate your lunch.
