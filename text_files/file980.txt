New fave strings for my Fender Jaguar & Jazzmaster! It gives my offsets extra balls. Unlike many flats which tend to sound dull/plucky and higher tension, these would still give you enough brightness and liveliness with a surprisingly balanced sound throughout all strings. It will be tuned fast and stays in tuned for weeks, they only need VERY minor tuning every now and then. Even the wounded G doesn't bother me, it's pretty subtle you almost wouldn't feel it. It's actually CHEAP considering how long these strings would last.

This will be my last brand of strings that I use from now on.
