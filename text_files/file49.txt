I have 3 of these now and I like that I can fit any type of guitar on there at the same time, even if they have straps on them. I have other stands that are spaced closer together and even a tremolo bar can get in the way. For those who have complained about no instructions being included, there are two bolts and 4 wheels. If you can't figure that out then maybe putting stuff together isn't your thing.

I like that the supports are rubber and not foam. I do have one of the 3 that has a weak bottom brace and makes the guitar tilt a bit. Only noticeable if you are that kind of person.
