This plate comes with a cheap, worthless jack installed in it. I was planning on throwing it away and installing a Switchcraft 11 jack in it instead. The mounting hole diameter was 9.5 mm, and the Switchcraft uses a 3/8" mounting hole, so I needed to use a 3/8" drill bit to widen the hole just slightly. 9.5 mm is .374 inches, so it is only one thousandth of an inch different, but did need to be expanded nevertheless. It also only came with 2 screws instead of the 4 needed. I had the four screws that came with the guitar anyway, from the plastic jack plate I was replacing, so that was no problem either. The screws were a bit bigger than the intended screws so it gave it a bit more of an industrial look that was unintentional but I think it looks good nonetheless. It was a little bigger than the old jack plate as well so I had to bondo in the screw holes and drill others out, but that's pretty much par for the course with aftermarket modifications of any sort.
