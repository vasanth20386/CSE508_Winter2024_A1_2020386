I have also dropped it more than once and it has proven to be durable, as well.  I am actually using it as a practice bass amp and it sounds like playing a bass through a guitar amp, which is acceptable for practice.  I gave it to my guitar player to use and he was very impressed with the improvement in the product, having used other 9 volt practice amps in the past.  Can easily be used to amplify any personal sound needs by using or purchasing a 1/4" input adapters.  It does not include a power adapter, which would have been a nice addition, so you have to use 9 volt batteries to power your practice sessions.  Watch my demonstration video.
