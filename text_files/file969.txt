These are great lights for the cost.  Currently have 17 in use for our theater. We built pyramids for a theater production. We have 5 lights filling the pyramid shape.  Been a great effect with huge applause for just the lighting.

Con
Limited instruction for DMX but this is only a limitation for a new user.
Plastic housing so keep safe distance from other stage lights or traditional hot bulbs.
