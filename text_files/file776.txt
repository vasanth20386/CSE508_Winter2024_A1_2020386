These stands are balanced, sturdy and lightweight. The locking strap is a nice feature but not even necessary. Not sure how some people are placing their guitars, but unless they have a defecting unit, it's pretty impossible to mess up. I use one for my Gibson Grabber bass and the other for my Taylor 114e acoustic. Works great for both!
