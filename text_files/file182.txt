It's may best solid state amps I ever had. Very versatile just one cons I can tell be aware when or need to use external pedals need optimization for work as you intended. It's very tricky (remember it's a modeler amp take this in consideration). But for a Stan-alone application it's the best. Have anything you'll need. Just connect your guitar and start playing as that easy.
