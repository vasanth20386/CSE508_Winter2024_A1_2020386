I manage a classic rock band. I recently ordered a bunch of stuff to replace aging gear. Cables, mics, stands, snakes, etc. We have now been out on a couple of gigs with the stuff. It is all good quality and working fine. Does exactly what I expected it to do. No surprises. In the interest of time I am applying this exact same review to all of the items I bought for this purpose and am happy with. FWIW, I am also taking the time to be critical of the items I am not completely happy with.

I am adding a picture for this road case also.
