I play 6, 7, and 8 string guitars and was able to tune all 3 with no problems. Quick detection, and accurate. Even the F# on the 8 string was picked up almost instantly.

It may be a drawback for some, but there's no option for a 9V battery. Pick up a Donner 9v plug w/ that comes with a pig tail that has 5 9v plugs on it.

He's a tiny little feller, but big things come in small packages.
