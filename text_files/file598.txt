Easy to fit to my violins top with a good sharp knife and some patience, need to get some better sand paper to make it a perfect fit. Please note this is not a bridge you can unpack and simply insert you must fit the feet to your violins top. Really enjoy the curve of the strings as well. All in all a great step up from the factory fit bridge that came on my instrument.
