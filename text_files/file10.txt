Awesome stand!

Tip: The bottom part that supports the guitar had a weird angle when arrived, making the guitar slide back, becoming almost 100% on a vertical.
To solve this, I assembled the product and the put a some pressure on the support frame, making it bend a little. Now my guitar sits perfectly. Check photos!
