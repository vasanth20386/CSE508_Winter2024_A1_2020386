First off this is NOT a leather strap. Only the ends are leather. I've owned this model in 3" several times. I keep coming back because of the style. But the glue they use to piece the front and back together cannot stand sweat. So it separates pretty quickly, after about 4 uses. The sad thing is the strap is made quite well except for the plastic end that holds the nylon strap part to it. If it breaks, your $2000 plus guitar takes a dive. Using strap locks, I would prefer if they used a metal part instead of the plastic part. But the separation is a real downer. All they would have to do is sew or use better glue. They must know this is a factory defect, but for many years now all my straps have done the same exact separation in the same exact place. Total I have purchased a dozen of these straps for my guitars.
