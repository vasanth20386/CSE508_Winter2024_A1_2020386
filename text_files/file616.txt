I own a Yamaha 61 keys Keyboard and I ordered this stand because the product description says it is Yamaha make. But what is written on the box is:'Keyboard Stand For Portable Keyboards from Yamaha and Others' and there is no Yamaha emblem neither on the box nor on the stand. In fact, it is just a Chinese make generic stand. Apart from that, I am happy with the stand. It is:

Easy to assemble and fold
Sturdy enough to hold a 61 keys keyboard
Keyboard fits well
