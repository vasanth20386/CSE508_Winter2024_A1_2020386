We have been using these for kids parties and play dates. These lights are great. Plug and play action. There is a speed knob on the unit to adjust the light chase speed and offer cool patterns. Ive been setting them up on top of my powered speakers and angle them to hit part of ceilings and tops of walls. They are bright so by mounting them like this prevents squinters on the dance floor and you can see the patterns with out the use of a fog machine. They are housed in plastic and are very light. Kids love them and offer a a Big Bang for just a few bucks
