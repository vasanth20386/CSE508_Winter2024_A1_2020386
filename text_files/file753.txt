This is the worst fitting junk I have ever seen! The pickgaurd is to big and the back plates are to small and the holes do not line up. I could make the pick guard work but it would take time with a drimel to make sure it fit properly without any gaps. The back plates are almost a full 1/4 inch off. waste of time and money.
