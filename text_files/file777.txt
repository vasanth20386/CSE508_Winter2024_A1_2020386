Fun and easy to install. Looks pretty cool too. Not sure how long they'll hold up after I install the strings and start practicing bends. Although they are thin, I still feel an slight edge when I run my fingers across them. We'll see,... kinda skeptical on how long these will last.
Update. OK, so they didn't last that long. After a couple of months the top seal started peeling off, then the next layer started to peel. There was a bit of goop left over after removal which was a hassle to get off. 0000 grade steel wool took care of the frets and my guitar is back to being good as new. Oh well, it still was a little fun.
