I ordered the RODE Podcaster and needed a shockmount that would work with it on the first try. I could have found a cheaper third party solution, but to be honest I wanted my Mic to have the products that were designed for it. That's why I went with the PSM1. It's got a perfect fit for the Podcaster and Procaster mic's. No real complaints from it thus far.

The shockmount is made from metal and seems very well constructed. The area that connects to the boom arm is plastic and it could strip if not careful, but so far it's been the right choice for the Podcaster.
