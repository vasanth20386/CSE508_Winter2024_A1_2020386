This board serves the purpose, and if you know what you're doing it is endlessly customizable.  Just got it today, but I have bg plans for making it work for me. As a good platform for pedals, it's pretty solid.

One thing I should say: it arrived in pretty rough shape.  The faux cobbled orange leather actually looks pretty bad-ass, but the handles on the top were both bent inwards (the right handle was bent to a 45 degree angle) and loose, and the left handle is beat to crap.  Personally, I don't care. That is a ten minute fix. But you might not be happy if you just spent a hundred bucks on it.
