I recently started using very light guage carbon strings (E1 is .024 inches) and E1 and B needed double knots (triple knots on E1)  to keep them tied and tuned.  Even then sometimes E1 would come loose.  A friend told me about string ties and suggested they might solve the problem. I looked around at the various tie systems available and I bought the Diamond Secure Classical Guitar String Ties because I liked the size. The result was what I needed; B and E1 don't slip with the ties and they stay in tune. I did a double loop with E1 as suggested in the instructions, just to be sure. I was concerned about the appearance of the Ties, but I am satisfied with the look. The Ties are small and have an unobtrusive,  neat appearance.  The attached picture shows my first effort with the Ties. In terms of sound or effect on the guitar I don't hear any difference, but the Ties do simplify the process of tying on strings.
