Man. No words can not be said. I have a Catalina Maple drum set. Once I placed this head on there and that first hit. It sound like a cannon. Perfect sound. It make you want to play all day. Made me want to start dancing.

I have had my eyes set on the product after the few Churchs that I have been to and they have this product and I knew this would be my next purchase. If you are in the market for a new drum head. If you are a hard hitter go with the Evans EMAD2. You will not be disappointed
