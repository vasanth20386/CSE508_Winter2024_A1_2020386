Absolutely amazing! I think they are direct knock-off of Seymour Duncan SH-2 Jazz Model Humbucker Pickups. (you can see the same little holes on each of pups) Powerful, bright sound, no noise. My old Johnson LP with ex "EMG-ish"  pickups are now fully awake and angry in a good way. Great quality! Thanks everyone for good review.
