I'd give it 5-stars if it was filled-in around the connector (cleaner look and easier to hit in the dark).  Otherwise it was a great solution to cleanly put  an access port on the front of my portable recording rig.  I have lots of USB-A to USB-B cables about, so that connected me to a standard USB audio interface inside the rack also with a B connector.  I already had another B-to-A adapter like this for a USB charging jack that is reversed, with the A-B cable on the inside going to a standard USB charger.

BTW, mixed responses in the Q/A section.  They may be coming from different suppliers or maybe not genuine Switchcraft, as mine did NOT come with any screws.
