Got to use my new Phitz bag for my five Aputure Amaran 672W for the first time yesterday. I was getting tired of always packing them in their individual cases. It's very well-made with really good quality zippers and construction, with roomy front and side pouches I haven't even used yet. :) The bag comes with 10 dividers (I only used 8...description says it comes with 8, but I'm pretty sure I got 10) which can be repositioned with velcro (probably much neater than I've done here).

To be fair, this is a softside padded case, so I won't be throwing it around like a stevedore, but the quick-draw action makes it fast and easy to pull the lights for set up. And packing is faster, too.

This bag is so well-constructed, I'm sure I'll be using it for years to come.

Full disclosure: I haven't been paid for this post, nor did I get the product for free. I just like spreading the news of great, relatively inexpensive, functional products when I get them.
