These cables are perfect for pedalboards that need a little more reach than average. They aren't as cheap looking as other budget cables.

Admittedly I'm not a cable snob, but I don't care for crap cables either. These are about the same quality as the Fender cables you see in the fishbowls of the big-brother music stores. One thing to keep in mind, if you mount your cables into a pedalboard and use zip ties, the cables don't move much and are less prone to breakage like your regular guitar cables. The DIY kits by George L and Planet Waves are ridiculously priced, and these are a great alternative.
