This hangar works very well and it is especially nice that it comes with the wall anchors and screws.  Installation and adjustment is super easy and it holds my guitars securely.  Note that the adjustment is by rotation of the arms to adapt to the neck size of your guitar.  The arms are padded to protect the finish on your guitar.
