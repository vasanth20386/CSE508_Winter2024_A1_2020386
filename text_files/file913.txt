The mic isn't the best I have ever seen but for the price range it sure is good. I was skeptical but the XLR did come in handy. And it is heaps better than any built in microphone for any other webcam, laptop etc. The headphones are excellent, far better than any other headphones you'll get for fifty bucks.

Mic and headphones have a weighty, good quality feel and it's sure as hell worth five stars.
