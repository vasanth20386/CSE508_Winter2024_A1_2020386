I received this pedal as a gift.  A compressor is a subtle effect, but it has made a great addition to my pedal board.  The construction of the pedal is solid.  It adds character to chords and enhances leads.  I am currently using the pedal with the sustain at 1 o'clock, the attack at noon, and the volume at 10 o'clock.  The volume provides a very strong boost after 11 o'clock.  Overall, good pedal for the price.
