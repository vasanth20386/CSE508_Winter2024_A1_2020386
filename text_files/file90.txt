A solid strap that I used on my Strat.  Very nice.  It's not flashy, which fits my style well.  Works well, solidly made.  No worries that the guitar is going to come off while playing.  I've taken some shots of the Poly Locks, check out the mechanism.  It's pretty nice.  Definitely will do what you want and last a good long while.
