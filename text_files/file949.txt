I use this with an&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/On-Stage-MY550-Microphone-Extension-Attachment-Bar/dp/B0002ZO3LK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">On Stage MY550 Microphone Extension Attachment Bar</a>&nbsp;to mount the mics that come in the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Nady-DMK-5-Drum-Mic-Package/dp/B0002GXUMW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Nady DMK-5 Drum Mic Package</a>. These are relatively small and light microphones, especially the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Nady-DM70-Drum-and-Instrument-Microphone/dp/B0002CZQOQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Nady DM70 Drum and Instrument Microphone</a>.

As you can see in the customer-supplied images at the top of this page this gooseneck holds the DM70 steadily, and has the length to allow me to place the mics where I want them. For example, using two of these and two of the extension bars, I can attach the assemblies to my hi-hat stand and mic both the rack tom, plus the hi-hat and snare drum combined with a separate DM70.

Another use I have is to use either this or a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/On-Stage-Microphone-6-inch-Gooseneck-Black/dp/B00080F7CS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">On Stage Microphone 6-inch Gooseneck, Black</a>&nbsp;(depending on where I want to place them) off a mic stand using the extension bar as a clamp. This arrangement allows me to place a DM70 for tenor and alto saxophones, or a DM80 for baritones.

For the smaller, lighter mics like the ones I use this is a perfect solution.
