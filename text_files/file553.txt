These are excellent clamps! I have no idea where the poor ratings below are coming from, for 35mm diameter truss tubing like the TRUSST systems (or any 35mm or 1-3/8" OD tubing ) these clamps fit like a glove, clamp tightly, have beautiful surface finish that won't scratch, flawless bolt and wingnut hardware, and work perfectly. Will also clamp securely to 1-1/4" OD tubing. The roll pins that secure the two halves and the toggle bolt are all firmly and properly fitted as well. I got 5 to try since they were such a great price and after receiving them went back for 10 more. These will not work on 1-1/2" or 1" or even 1-1/8" tubing, get the other models for that, measure your tubing! These are also great for putting a light on top of a speaker tripod stand, most of which have a 1-3/8" tube on top, add the clamp and bolt on your light.
