This pickguard is wonderful, didn't have to mod it in any way, and I was concerned because the old one on the guitar is bigger then this one.  Thought I would have some visible holes on the guitar but nope it fit like a glove. Now I have a great looking guitar, oh let's don't forget the price.  Very low price, awesome product came with screws most don't so why buy a name brand at 5 times the cost.
