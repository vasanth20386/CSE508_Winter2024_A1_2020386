For the price of tunable bongos you get 3 roto-toms and a stand.  An inexpensive way to expand your current drum set.

Hardware is ok at best buy for this price one can't complain. It does the job.

I placed the stand between the 10 & 8 inch toms and the hi-hat between the 6 & 8 inch toms.

A great deal for $99.00.
