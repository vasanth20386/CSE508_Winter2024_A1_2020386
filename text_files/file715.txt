I am rather pleased with these par lights! They are very bright. The sound active and DMX features both work extremely well! The build quality is decent and the colors are very vibrant. For this level of quality at such a good price makes this par light a great deal. I personally use these lights for my speaker stand skrims but they are also perfect for up lighting.
