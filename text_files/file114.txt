Gibson, please do as promised, you should sell more like this price.
We want affordable Gibson, and finally Gibson have this, but when we want buy it, Gibson said NO, it's sold out, you can only buy from private sellers for $400 more. Or you pay $2000 more for a high end Gibson.
Are you kidding me? Gibson want fool customers with this price.
Make more affordable Les paul gold top. people love gold top. Do not be too greedy.
