The picture doesn't do this bridge justice, I was skeptical of the quality when I ordered this Tremolo bridge but was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. I wasn't so concerned with the quality because I planed on using it on an old broken down imported Kramer ST300 that I refinished. I gave it a 3 because of the screws it takes a lot of hand strength to get the screws seated. You have to be very careful that you don't strip the philip screw heads the screw driver doesn't quit fit the number 2. I'll take the guitar to my shared work shop to see if a larger screw driver fits better.
