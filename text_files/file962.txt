Excellent budget 7 string , Had to touch up the fret work a bit and tighten down some of the screws but other than that it was perfect . Replaced the original strings with 11-64 for A standard tuning . i wasn't sure if i was getting 22 or 24 frets on the guitar as it said both in the description but it did come with 24 frets . Have been playing Korn and trivium covers so far and its perfect for it . Stock ESP pups are not to bad , decent tone , i'm using a peavy 6505+ amp .
