Let Me Start Of By Saying That This Is My First New Drum Set In 10 Years, And It Totally Rocks,It Is A Great Sounding Set! (Wouldn't Hurt To Upgrade Heads And Cymbals) But The Current Ones Will Hold Over, Until I Can Get Upgrades Other Than That I Am Very Happy With This Set It Is An Excellent Upgrade From My Old One And Comes Through 100% Best Purchase Made! (Silver Snare Drum Is My Own) Not To Confuse It With The Set.
