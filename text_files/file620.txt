This dampener works OK, but man it is really clumsy and obtrusive. When it's in the up position you can poke someone's eye out. You're better off learning to use the palm of your hand at the bridge of your guitar to dampen or muffle the sound or try tying a "hanky" (handkerchief) at the top of the neck.
