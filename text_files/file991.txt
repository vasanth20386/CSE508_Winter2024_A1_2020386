These are not bad for the price and have a good feel to them weight wise. I would say beginner sticks for sure but once you get to be a better drummer and you are learning how to make different sounds with your kit like a rim shot. These will snap off fast. It didn't take too long for my son to snap the tip off doing a rim/head hit. if these are for a electric kit, I would give these a 5 star for that perpose
