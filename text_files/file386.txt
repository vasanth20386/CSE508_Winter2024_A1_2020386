Garbage. Plastic strap adjuster has broken! From gentle studio use only!!! Very, very flimsy. You get what you pay for...I just have way too many guitars and needed an extra strap. I've already cannibalized this strap for the pad. so it's a keeper now. STAY AWAY FROM THIS P.O.S. and buy a more expensive, quality guitar strap.
