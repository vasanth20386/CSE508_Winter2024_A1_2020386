I've been using this little amp for over a month now and totally love it.  I run it into a small cabinet with a Jensen Vintage C8R4 8-inch ceramic speaker housed in a maple 12" x 12" cabinet and it sounds amazing.  If you closed your eyes you would think you were hearing a Fender Tweed combo from the 50's.  I use a delay/reverb combo pedal in the effects loop insert and it's as sweet as the larger setups I have in my main music room.  I use this in my office and it's perfect for the space.  I can't believe such vintage tones can come out of a chip-amp that is as small as a stomp pedal.  If you're looking for extremely high gain, try one of the other Hotone amps like the Legacy British Invasion or Purple Wind.
