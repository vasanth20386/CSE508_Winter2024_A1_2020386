I like this little small light! It fits in your hand and is a decent output of light. It is dmx which we all know is awesome! Dmx makes the world a little easier to control! The colors are red green blue and white. The only thing I do not like is the way the colors are mixed, you can see the outside of the color when you mix them. I would put one quad led in the fixture so it's all under one lense and there's no bleeding. But other than that this fixture is awesome!
