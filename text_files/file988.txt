You can find cheaper power supply units, but they tend to add noise.  Thanks to Amazon's return policy, I was able to try out a couple units.  The MXR M238 unit worked great and is very quiet.  Pedals can be very picky and I had trouble with chaining some of the pedals together.  The MXR pedal was the best option for me, it had enough sockets and the size of the unit worked great for my board.
