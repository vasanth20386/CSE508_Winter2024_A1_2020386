I was able to install my new guitar hanger easily. I found a stud exactly where I wanted to install it, and I predrilled the holes to accommodate the two long wood screws; drywall anchors are included in the package.

The metal bracket is sturdy, and the wooden plate is held in place with a key-like spacer sleeved around the hanger bolt.

I am impressed with the results. I highly recommend this guitar hanger for anyone whose guitar is taking up room on the floor.
