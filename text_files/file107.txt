This case was bought for my Epiphone Les Paul Black Beauty 3 which fits inside pretty well, although there is a little wiggle room. The case appears to be built well, however, the case lid is misaligned with the base section when closed shut. The lid should overlap the bottom case similar to how a shoe box lid fits on top of its box. The misalignment creates an odd gap which is only noticeable upon close inspection. I have a similar Epiphone case for my Sheraton and that case closes properly like my shoe box example. So beware production quality may not be consistant and could vary on a case to case basis (I couldn't resist that pun).

Also, I feel my guitar should fit more snugly inside the case similar to how my Gretsch G5120 Electromatic fits inside its Gretsch G6241FT Flat Top case. My Gretsch G5120 has a snug (almost tight) fit inside its G6241FT case which allows absolutely no wiggle room.

Aside from the two aforementioned complaints, I am generally satisfied with the Epiphone case. It provides an adequate shelter for my Les Paul when not in use.
