The case that these two came in is very durable. The microphones and clips are securely padded within the case, which makes transporting them a breeze . We tested these out and they worked perfectly fine through the PA. The microphones sounded very clean, but on the bass(ier?) side, which can be adjusted if desired. Overall, this is a great buy! It is really awesome that these come as a set and with a nice hard case! In action, they work really well and 100% could be used in a professional setting. Thanks, Audio 2000s!
