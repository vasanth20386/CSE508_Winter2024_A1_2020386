This USB guitar/instrument cable lets you connect an electrical musical instrument to a PC directly through the USB port. This takes a few minutes to auto-install the drivers when you plug it in. Once installed it worked smoothly. It seems to be solidly constructed and it fits fine on both the USB plug and the guitar. Take note that it was listed on my computer as a headphone device rather than an instrument cable, so don't get confused by how it is listed in the USB devices. I would say this is worth trying if you want a USB musical instrument cable. I received a discounted sample for my honest, unbiased review.
