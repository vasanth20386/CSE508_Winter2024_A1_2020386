I have a garage sale piece of junk MIJ hollowbody that I've used Amazon to build for cheap.  It's been a blast and this fit the bill perfectly.

I cannot tell you how surprised I am at how good this sounds with this guitar.  It has inspired me to play open tuning slide because the tone through a simple Boss distortion pedal is so cool.

I would absolutely purchase this again for another cheapo build!

If you're looking at this, buy it.  Don't think twice.
