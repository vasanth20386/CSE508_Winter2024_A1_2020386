I bought it open box from online music store.
Exchanged from Mackies Thumps 12.
Difference is huge. Amazing clarity, even response, smooth high and lot of bass if you need it (via EQ).
Mackies back plate is hot all the time and that worried me, Yamaha cool all the time with active cooling.
Mackies dip around 2.5 K which makes them muddy and (crossover too high 3K), Yamaha no dips in frequency range, super clear and tight bass.
Fantastic for outdoors since they can go loud without losing clarity. For big bass lovers (boomy) get a inexpensive subwoofer.
It is much better solution than getting 15 inch cabinets since the bass will be seperated better from woofer and 12 inch deliver more even and clear mids.
I listen to QSC 10 & 12 in comparison and they sounded not as clear including bass plus they are much heavier.
