these capos are easy to use, high quality materials, flawless mecanism, adjustable pressure, an investment for a life. Just be know that there are two versions:
 Perfomance 1 (discontinued) : Extremely nice pressure and good looking, a little bulky, but non intrussive, the best choice for long scale guitar (25.4").
Performance 2 (new version) : light and narrow, easy to handle with one hand, the only con is that It lacks a little in pressure (compared to P1). i will use It in a short scale (24.9") guitar.
pd: i have only try It on my acoustic 25.4 scale Martin 1 3/4 " neck. i own both and i love the Performance 1 better. Look at the pics to see the differences between both.
