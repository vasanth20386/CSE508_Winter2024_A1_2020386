They're pretty decent panels for what it's worth. By far they're not professional grade, but I think they can do well for a small home studio. They are fairly thin, so initially it's going to absorb higher frequencies better than lower frequencies, so keep that in mind.

What I did to hang mine safely without causing damage to the walls: I purchased 12"x12" Medium Weight Chipboard sheets and used 3M spray adhesive to stick the foam to the board. Then, I used 1 4lb rated velcro command strip (per each panel) and put it on the wall. It's holding fairly well, and because it's a velcro command strip, you can make slight adjustments as needed.
