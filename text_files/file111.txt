I never knew this thing existed. I'm so glad I found this as I was always using a regular capo and placing it on just the 5 strings but the grip and placement was awkward and didn't provide a confident grip. Using this allows good grip. I use this a lot to practice my finger-picking songs...gotta love that low E, open string, bass note. Thank you Planet Waves for making this and in a simplistic yet convenient form.
