I'm using these high hats for a small kit ,( Pearl Rhythm traveler drum set. ) and they give a good sizzle. For the price that you're paying these little guys give you a great sound. I wouldn't get these if you're planing on playing "pro live shows", or recording. I have a pair of zildjian titanium cymbals / high hats and you can tell the difference. These high hats don't hold / sustain their sound for too long. If you're playing rock beat or just starting off.. These are a great starter set, and for the price you can't really disagree. A must have for a start to advanced player.
