Worked for maybe 30 minutes then it died and never came back on. Used standard pedal power supply to power it. What I heard sounded good, but its internals died so quickly. Tried batteries, and other power supplie afterwards. Nothing worked. Refunded and got a Dr. Scientist Pedal and have been amazed.
