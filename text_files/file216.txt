I got mine at a music store, not here, but wanted to give a review. First, it is a $40 uke... so people need to keep this in mind. I got it to play a campfires,  the beach, by my hot tub, etc. I am not expecting  it to sound like wood. Given that, I am very pleased. It is a great novelty item. People say theirs does not stay in tune, but mine does.  I can hang it on the wall and not touch it for several months. It  is still pretty much in tune, with some minor adjustment. But I would expect that from a wooden or more expensive one as well.  I added some miniature lights off Amazon and it certainly serves its purpose.  Enough light to see if I want to play in the dark, and also can be festive as well.  I have never regretted purchasing this.
