It does what it's supposed to do, and does it well. A medium Fender pick measures .72 thick on my digital caliper. An Amazon gift card is the same and my expired driver license is ..78. My credit card is. 78. Expired cards will keep you in picks for a long time! The attached pic shows you can get 5 picks from a standard size card.
