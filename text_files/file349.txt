I love this little guy. I was looking for a simple combo amp to use at the church I play at. This amp is plenty loud, and has great sound quality. That's it. No frills. And it looks cool too.

I should mention that the arrangement of the church group is just a piano, guitar, and vocals. With that arrangement, I have my volume about 1/3 of the way up. Haven't tried this amp against drums yet, but I'm fairly confident it would cut through. At least playing with "church drums."
