I needed to replace poorly built, wobbly and ugly green Wilkinson tuners on my Vintage V100PGM ICON Lemon Drop Greeny guitar.

These tuners require 10mm holes in the headstock. Mine had 9mm holes. The description on Amazon didn't say that. Also, the color on these tuners are dull green and not cream like in the picture. I returned them to Amazon.
