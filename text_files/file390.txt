The Xvive Sweet Leo O2 Distortion pedal is a great budget lead lead pedal. Im super impressed with the build quality and packaging from Xvive as well as the tones. If you are looking for a good lead distortion pedal that functions like how a tube amp works, you may want to consider this pedal. In this video I test it out on my Stratocaster (Partscaster) with humbucker pickups.
