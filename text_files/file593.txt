So i needed a cheap guiar that i could bang into walls and not care, so i got this thinking it would be perfect for the job. Sadly, i fell in love with it even though they sent me the wrong guitar. (Amazon falsely advertised it). I got the brown sunburst (absolutely beautiful) but instead of a white puckguard, i got brown sparkly one. Oh well $10 and 30 minutes later and i can fix that. Anyway. It sounds great for a $125 and plays amazingly.
