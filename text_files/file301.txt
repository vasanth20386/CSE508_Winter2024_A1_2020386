These wall hangers are superb. I don't understand why others of inferior quality cots twice as much. These are made out of solid wood (looks like Pinewood) glazed over with weather protective urethane. The great thing about this is that it supports all sizes of guitars, from small Ukuleles to full size. That is due to the rubber rings which they include to avoid smaller necks falling out. Another very nice thing is that the arm is screwed into a wood nut, which makes it super secured while allowing for movement in case you have odd neck shapes (like fender strats) which require a little angle.

I have several of these and would for sure recommend it over any other one available due to the price point and the quality of the materials.
