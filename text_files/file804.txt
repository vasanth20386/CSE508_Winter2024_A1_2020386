What a great new preamp from Fishman the Platinum Stage. It so small fits in a guitar case.  It gets rid of the low mud tone. In guitar mode the bass is at 150Hz, theres a low cut switch for 30hz, 80Hz, and 160Hz.  The middle is from 200Hz-3.1kHz Q1.3 and treble is at 6kHz.  I like that this is battery powered so I can use it with the Bose S1 Pro and my guitars with LR Baggs or Fishman pickups.  On the Cordoba F7 Paco w Fishman Ellipse it sounds great.  Thanks Fishman #FishmanElectronics #Fishman
