Great value for a hard case, holds lots of guitars, including jaguar, or even a Les Paul. Only issue is... that there's not enough padding,  and some guitars might knock around if You don't add some additional support.

Update:  this case can hold a variety of guitars, including a jaguar, les Paul, Strat, Tele, and G&L fallout.  As I mentioned previously, you may need to add some padding or a Velcro strap over the next report to stabilize the guitar.
 I also added a picture with a Epi SH inside.
