First of all, I am a HUGE Fender fan. Guitars, amps and especially their pickups.  Second, when it comes to tone, I am very picky. I love the Fender Custom Shop 69s, 54s, 57/62s and Fat 50s. I wanted to try something other than Fender this time, so I chose these SSL-1s. So far I think they are absolutely the best single coil pickup I have ever had. Big, full tone with bell-like highs and a clear bottom end.  On a lot of pickups in Strats the neck pickup can sound too quacky, too much twang and it over powers everything else.  These strike a very nice balance with quack and all the other harmonics that are present.  Some other vintage single coils Ive tried have too much chimey-ness in the tone, too much high, drowns out the mids, again these SSL-1s don't do that, even though there is still tons of chimey, bell-like tones, like glass breaking, very brilliant, but its balanced out with the mid and low tones as well.  Very nice and yes I would buy them again.
