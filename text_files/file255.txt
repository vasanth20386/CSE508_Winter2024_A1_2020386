Mine were very stiff and hard to tune, no smoothness, like there was dirt or grit in the gears.  After installing one of the tuning keys got super stiff and before I could get up to tune the head snapped off.  Had to return entire set...pain in the azz.  Not worth the money in savings, going with Hipshots next.
