This is a very nice Crash / Ride Cymbal. I'm using it for a smaller kit I'm using for a school I'm working at. The kids seem to enjoy the sound, and it's taking a beating. Its holding up to the challenge.

It's not a top end cymbal, but you wouldn't be look at it if you where a top end drummer. Am I right?

You're looking for something cheap that sounds okay, or good enough.. This is it.. Stop looking, trust me. For the price you're paying, this is the one you're looking for.  It give you really nice sound, plus its not going to fall apart after a few uses.
