My first effects pedal was the Donner Blues Drive and I absolutely LOVE IT! For my birthday this year, I decided to order some more pedals from Donner and start building a pedalboard. With the quality and affordability of these pedals, you really can't go wrong. I play mostly in church with our praise band and this chorus pedal works perfectly for what I need it for!
