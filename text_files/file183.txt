I'm a guitar player who sometimes needs to play bass.  My brother bought me for Christmas.  I was pleasantly surprised by this guitar's feel and sound when unplugged!  It FEELS solid and has great sustain unplugged!  It played easy right out of the box though I will eventually get it set up but I'm not in a rush.  With this gift came a Fender Rumble 25 bass amp that for what I need is perfect and sounds great.  I'm very impressed overall and would recommend this bass to someone looking for a quality instrument without the "quality" price tag.
