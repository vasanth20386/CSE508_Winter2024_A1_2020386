Absolutely awesome cables for the money. I've bought a number of these in different colors. The connectors are really decent and the cables are very well made- nice silicone jacket.  I've shortened a number of these LyxPro cables using the original ends for balanced line use in a patch bay.and also using, Neutrix TRS connectors, Neutric XLR's, Switchcraft right angle TRS ends, and even some ends of off some Seismic Audio cables.
