I bought this after watching a review on Youtube; search: "Satchel Yamaha THR10X".  This little beast sounds so big for how small it is.  I used to have a small Crate for a practice amp... that's not a practice amp.  THIS is a practice amp... You won't have to sacrifice tone to play in your bedroom/office.
