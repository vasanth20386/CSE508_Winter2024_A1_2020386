Within a month of buying the device, the door that covers the SD card snapped off - a common problem with these recorders. Very poorly engineered.

Last week I pulled the device out of a padded camera bag and one of the plastic (painted to look like metal) XLR ejector tabs had broke off.

I needed to capture a recording off a mixing board with the balanced jack and had to use an XLR cable. I thought there was enough of the ejector to remove it but it's stuck. I disassembled the cable and have done everything I can to remove it short of opening the recorder.

Tascam wants me to send it into them, and from the stories I hear they are probably going to charge me $90 to fix a device that is less than a year old.

I will probably use a hacksaw to get the plug off and just use it as is until it dies. I'll buy a ZOOM next time. It's a shame because this device records great, even though the omni mics. For this much $ Tascam needs to prove quality, especially if they are going to say a product is rugged.
